CHAPTER V 

The Use of Fused Silica 

BY 

H. V. Neher 

General remarks on fused quartz. Formerly made only 
in rod and tube form, fused quartz 1 is now often employed 
as a substitute for glass in chemical ware, and most of the 
common pieces used in chemistry are now obtainable in 
this material. Such articles as flasks, beakers, dishes, 
plates, and so forth, are in fairly common use. 

Apparatus made from fused quartz has two chief ad- 
vantages over that made from glass. The low thermal 
expansion coefficient eliminates all fear of breakage due to 
rapid temperature changes. A hot piece of quartz plunged 
into water suffers no ill effects. Also, its relatively high 
melting point makes possible the study of reactions which 
would be more difficult with glass. 

As will be pointed out later, many of its properties make 
it valuable in instruments of various kinds and when con- 
stancy is a prime requisite. One particularly valuable prop- 
erty of fused quartz is its extremely low loss of energy due 
to internal friction when stresses are applied. The loss 
amounts to only 10~ 3 of that in the best of the metals. 
Another property of value lies in its constancy of length. 
It not only has an extremely small thermal expansion 
coefficient, but returns to its original length after having 
been heated or cooled. 

The chief disadvantage of fused quartz is its high cost, 

1 Fused quartz is obtainable from the Thermal Syndicate and the General 
Electric Company. Each carries a large stock of quartz products and will 
make special pieces on demand. 

188

due mainly to the fact that it has a high melting point and 
demands special methods for its manufacture. The fact 
that it fuses with difficulty makes the working of tubing 
greater than an inch in diameter more or less impractical in 
the laboratory. Although an oxyhydrogen flame becomes 
useful when working large pieces of quartz, small pieces can 
be worked easily with an oxy-natural gas flame. An ordi- 
nary Bunsen burner flame using natural gas is hot enough to 
soften small pieces. 

A very useful property discovered by C. V. Boys 2 in 1889, 
and discussed in detail later, is that fused quartz can be 
drawn into fine fibers which have remarkable strength. 
Fibers of any size down to 1/x (0.0001 cm) diameter or less 
can be easily and rapidly produced. No other vitreous ma- 
terial can in any way approach fused quartz in performance 
when made into these fine fibers. 

Chemical properties. Fused silica at room temperature 
is inactive to practically all chemicals except hydrofluoric 
acid and the alkalies. However, at high temperatures it 
reacts with most metallic salts, forming silicates. This is 
due to the fact that silicon dioxide is an acid in the general 
sense of the term, and as such reacts vigorously at high tem- 
peratures with metallic oxides which are bases. The noble 
metals do not form silicates, and a quartz fiber covered with 
gold may be heated until the gold evaporates, without 
harming the fiber. 

Physical properties. Thermal properties. The coefficient 
of thermal expansion of fused quartz rod under no stress has 
been measured with considerable accuracy. 3 The mean 
values near room temperature, defined by a = (l/l)(Al/tt — ti) 
are given in Table I. For comparison, steel has a coefficient 
of 10.1 X 10 _6 °C. _1 , or 25 times as large, while for Invar a is 
about 0.9 X 10 _6 °C. _1 . The coefficient of thermal expan- 
sion has not been measured for various sizes of fibers under 
varying amounts of strain.

The coefficient of thermal hysteresis of fused quartz 
is less than for any other known material. If a substance 
of length I is heated from a temperature h to a tempera- 
ture U. and allowed to cool to U, then (l/l)(Al/t2—t 1 ) ) where 
Al is the residual difference in length, is a measure of the 
thermal hysteresis. For quartz, this quantity is —1 to 
— 5 X 10 -9 °C. -1 ; that is, it contracts more than it expands. 
In comparison, Invar has a similar coefficient of —100 X 
10 _9 °C. -1 . This property makes fused quartz particularly 
valuable when it is necessary to maintain dimensions 
accurately. 4 

If fused quartz is held at a temperature above 1200°C. for 
some time, crystallization gradually takes place, beginning 
at the surface and working inward. As the temperature is 
raised, the crystallization becomes more rapid until a tem- 
perature is reached at which the crystals melt. When quartz 
is worked locally in a flame, a milky surface will form be- 
tween the soft quartz and the cool portion. This is probably 
due to condensation of evaporated quartz and does no harm 
to the material except in appearance. 

Elastic properties. The normal coefficient of elasticity, 
or the reciprocal of Young's modulus for quartz rod at room

millan Company, 1922-1923.

temperature, was measured first by Boys. This coefficient 

is denned by 

1 _ 1 M 

Y ~ I AS n ' 

where Y is Young's modulus and S„ is the normal stress. 
Boys found the value Y = 5.2 X 10 u dynes cm~ 2 , which is 
very near the most recently determined values for fibers 
from 50ju to lOO^t in diameter. Young's modulus varies 
with the size of the fiber, becoming greater as the size of 
the fiber diminishes. This variation can be expressed by 

27 X 10 u 



Y = 



d 



+ 5.9 X 10 11 dynes cm- 2 , 



where d is the diameter of the fiber in microns. This rela- 
tion fails to hold, giving values too large, for fibers less 
than 10ju in diameter. Experimental values of Y for various 
sizes of fibers are given in Table II. The increase in modulus 
of elasticity with decrease in size is due to the importance of 
the surface layer for the smaller fibers, which has a different 
elastic constant.

These are mean values; values of individual fibers may be as much as 
20 per cent higher or lower than those given. Units are in dynes cm -2 .

The tangential coefficient of elasticity, or the reciprocal of 
the rigidity modulus, for solid rod of radius r and length I, is 

defined as 

1 = 1 AQ) 
Z ~~ 21 AS, ' 

where S, is the tangential stress and <t> is the angle of twist 
of the rod. For a uniform solid round rod S t = {L/r)/(irr 2 ), 
where L is the applied torque and r is the radius. Z has a 
minimum value of 3 X 10 11 dynes cm -2 but depends, as does 
Y, on the size of the fiber, as shown in Table II. 

Two other elastic quantities are very often useful. The 
first indicates how much a fiber can be stretched before it 
breaks, that is, 

(t) - ^ 

\ ^ /for failure -* 

where (S n ) f is the normal stress for failure. Values of 
Al/l for failure are given in Table II. These apply only 
to fresh, clean fibers or those which have been kept perfectly 
clean and dry. (See below as to how to preserve fibers.) 
As far as is known, no other material approaches this factor. 
For the best nickel- vanadium steels the ratio is about 0.01. 
A comparison of Young's modulus for each material shows 
that quartz fiber compares favorably in strength with the 
strongest materials known. 

The second quantity indicates how much a fiber can be 
twisted without failure, that is, 

\ ' /for failure ^ 

for fibers up to 20/* in diameter, where (S,) f is the tangential 
stress for failure. This ratio also increases as the size of the 
fiber decreases. Thus, a fiber 5/u, in diameter can be twisted 
through at least 20 revolutions per centimeter of length 
before it fails. It should be remarked that the elastic limits 
for both normal and tangential stresses are coincident with 
the point of failure. 



Chap. V] THE USE OF FUSED SILICA 193 

Another property of quartz which enhances its value for 
electrometer and other suspensions is its low internal vis- 
cosity. If a fiber is twisted through an angle <j>, then the 
shearing stress is not strictly a constant but depends on 
time, thus: 

St - Z 2i + 2di\T/ 

The coefficient rj is a measure of the internal friction, or 
viscosity. Some representative values 5 are given in 
Table III.

If a fiber of length I and radius r is allowed to oscillate 
in a vacuum with a body of moment of inertia / suspended 
from the lower end, and if T is the period and X the loga- 
rithmic decrement of the vibration, the coefficient of viscosity 

in poises is given by 

8Il\ 

If such a torsion pendulum has a period of 2 seconds, it will 
lose about 10 per cent of its amplitude in 24 hours. 

Thus 77, as defined above, should be as small as possible if 
the internal losses are to be kept at a minimum.

194 THE USE OF FUSED SILICA [Chap. V 

Thermal-elastic properties. Both Young's modulus and 
the rigidity modulus for fused quartz depend on tempera- 
ture. Each becomes greater with moderate increase in 
temperature. Boys 6 gives the coefficient of Y as 1.3 X 
10 -4 °C. -1 , and for Z it is the same. For very accurate work 
any instrument using quartz fiber should be calibrated at 
more than one temperature. 

Hardness. Fused silica has a hardness of 7 on the 1 to 10 
scale. It is thus harder than glass and also harder than 
most of the metals. 

Surface tension of molten silica. If a fiber is heated until 
the quartz becomes quite soft, it will tend either to shrink 
and enlarge at the point of heating or to pull apart, depend- 
ing on the tension. We may define the surface tension as the 
force per unit of circumference tending to pull the fiber to- 
gether. This varies with the temperature, but an average 
value will be 250 dynes cm -1 . In comparison, glass has a 
surface tension of 140 to 160 dynes cm -1 . 

Electrical properties. When fused quartz is clean and dry, 
it is probably the best electrical insulator known. For 
this reason it is useful in such apparatus as electroscopes and 
electrometers, in which leakage must be reduced to a mini- 
mum. If used in the open air, quartz covered with the wax 
known as ceresin is still better than amber as an insulator. 
Care should be taken that the ceresin is that distilled from 
the natural mineral and not the synthetic material very often 
sold. When it is applied, the temperature of both the quartz 
and the ceresin should be from 80° to 100°C. for the first 
dip. Thicker coatings can be applied by allowing the 
quartz to cool before dipping again. 

The absorption of electrical charge, or "soak-in," is ex- 
tremely low, being less than 10 per cent of that for amber. 
The use of quartz in the form of fibers. The remarkable 
property of retaining and even increasing its strength as it is 
drawn into fine fibers makes the number of applications of

quartz to fine instruments many and varied. Few scientists, 
it seems, have realized and appreciated its values. Stronger 
than any of the metals used for suspensions, with the ex- 
ception of tungsten, it has the advantage that it can be made 
according to the specific requirements. Although some 
practice is necessary to acquire the proper skill, its acquisi- 
tion would seem eminently worth while, considering the 
results that can be obtained. 

Equipment useful in making and working with quartz 
fibers. A description of the torch burning natural gas and 
oxygen used by the author of this chapter will be given. If 
other gases are used, it may be necessary to modify the 
technique given below to meet the specific conditions. 

The torch is made from a piece of brass tubing bent into 
the shape shown in Fig. 1 and having one end threaded for

removable tips. The best size of opening for quartz work 
is about 2 mm in diameter. Other sizes of tips from 1 to 3 
mm in diameter will be found useful. To produce the neces- 
sary long steady flame, the length of the hole in the tip 
should be at least five times its diameter. The oxygen and 
gas are mixed at some distance from the torch. An ordinary 
T is sufficient for this mixing. It is necessary to have a 
ready means of control for both the gas and the oxygen.

If the latter is under high pressure, a reduction valve in 
conjunction with a needle valve gives the best regulation. 
A combination of needle valves and T which has been found 
to give satisfactory service is shown in Fig. 2. 

In using such a torch, care should be taken in lighting to 
turn the gas on first, light it, and then gradually turn the 
oxygen on until the proper flame is produced. To extinguish 
the flame, turn the oxygen off slowly and then the gas. Dis- 
regard of this procedure may 
result in a backfire into the 
line but usually does little dam- 
age except to sensitive nerves. 
The described torch is a use- 
ful adjunct to any laboratory, 
especially when supplied with 
tips of various sizes. It is 
ideal for working Pyrex glass 
as well as quartz. When 
quartz fibers are being made, 
the torch is held by a clamp so 
that the flame is vertical. 
Indispensable in the working of small pieces of quartz is a 
small torch shown in Fig. 1, identical with the larger one 
except for size, and using the same gases, which are controlled 
by separate fine needle valves. The best metal tubing for 
this torch is brass or copper xg- inch in internal diameter. 
The gases are led from the mixer to the torch by T^-inch 
rubber tubing. Small volumes throughout are important, or 
much time will be wasted in waiting for a change of gas 
mixture to arrive at the tip. The tips should be inter- 
changeable and should have openings of from 0.05 to 0.2 mm 
in diameter. A slight modification of design (illustrated) 
permits the torch to be mounted and manipulated by me- 
chanical means. The usefulness of this small torch will 
become apparent later.

tion of from 300 to 1000 is very useful. With some experi- 
ence the sizes of fibers can be judged to within 20 to 50 per 
cent by the amount of scat- 
tered light, the way they 
weave in the air, and so forth, 
but in many cases the diam- 
eter is important, and an ac- 
curate means of determining 
their size is invaluable. 

After blowing out a fine fiber, 
two places are marked, and 
the position of the intervening 
portion is thus determined by 
small tabs. Dennison's No. 
251 tabs are recommended. 

In many instances one 
works with fibers from a few 
centimeters to 10 or even 20 cm in length. In these cases 
the fibers are mounted on a two-pronged fork. This is 
easily made as shown in the sketch, Fig. 3. The end of

allow some freedom to the fiber, since the quartz tips will 
bend if the fiber is pulled one way or the other. Rigid 
supports result in many more broken fibers. The fiber is 
fastened to the tips with a small piece of hard wax. 

In cases in which one fiber is melted to another, each will 
shrink, and the quartz will gather at the junction. It is 
necessary then to have two forks, each with movable prongs.

The fork designed according to Fig. 4 has proved very satis- 
factory. If the handles are attached at different angles, the 
two forks can be worked together more easily. 

A hot wire mounted as in Fig. 5 has many uses and is 
especially valuable in melting small pieces of wax. The 
resistance wire can be any one of several, such as platinum, 
German silver, Chromel, Nichrome, and so forth. It should 
be 24-26 B and S gauge. A toy transformer with variable 
voltage of from 1 to 6 volts is convenient for controlling the 
temperature. A foot switch is very useful, since both 
hands may be occupied when the heat is wanted. 

In testing for conductivity of quartz fibers which have a 
coating of metal, a probe (see Fig. 6) with a fine platinum

wire tip finds a use. For such testing high voltages should 
not be used, since the resulting sparking will remove the 
metal from the fiber around the point of contact. Several 
volts applied through a 100,000-ohm resistance and a low-

sensitivity galvanometer will be found satisfactory for 
qualitative work. 

Waxes are indispensable in fastening fibers either tempo- 
rarily or permanently. For general use Dennison's hard red 
wax, DeKhotinsky wax, or flake shellac is recommended. 
If the wax is holding in place two or more fibers which are to 
have a metal evaporated or sputtered onto them, one of the 
latter two waxes should be used and heated until polymeriza- 
tion takes place, resulting in a material either difficult or 
impossible to melt. Otherwise the heat developed during 
the process of depositing the metal may cause the wax to 
soften and the fibers to be displaced.

In case it is necessary to hold a fiber temporarily and to 
maintain its desirable qualities, a wax must be used which, 
when heated, will completely disappear and not react in any 
way with the quartz. None of the products sold as waxes 
serve the purpose. An organic chemical which has the 
desired properties is diphenylcarbazide. It usually comes in 
powdered form and should be as pure as possible and espe- 
cially free from inorganic materials. 

In handling small pieces of wax, holding fibers, bending 
quartz fibers, and so forth, a piece of quartz 100/z in diameter 
and 2 to 3 cm long, waxed into the end of a metal rod, is very 
useful. (See Fig. 7.) It will also be found that a needle 



200 



THE USE OF FUSED SILICA 



[Chap. V 



work 



mounted in the end of a metal rod has many uses. It is 
recommended that several such quartz and needle holders 
be available. 

When working with small objects, tweezers of various 
sizes are very convenient. These can be obtained from 
jeweler's supply houses or from most houses supplying 
scientific apparatus. For very fine work, watch-hairspring 
tweezers such as #3C made by Dumont & Fils, Switzerland, 
are recommended. Also valuable in cutting fibers are small 
scissors. These may be a good grade of manicure scissors 
or dissecting scissors used in biological work. A nick should 

be made in one blade to prevent 
large fibers from slipping. If the 
scissors are guided by mechanical 
means, small fibers (up to 40/x) 
can be cut off as little as 0.01 mm 
at a time under a microscope. 

In most fiber work it is neces- 
sary to fix the position of the fiber 
with some accuracy. Small tri- 
pods with adjustable feet, to- 
gether with clamps and rods, as 
shown in Fig. 8, will serve to hold 
the various forks, needles, and so 
forth, used in the process of mount- 
ing the fibers. It is very difficult 
to hold a fiber still enough by hand, and it is always best 
to take advantage of mechanical devices wherever possible. 
Very small fibers (1m and less) can be easily seen by 
scattered light against a black background. Black velvet 
is one of the best. If the diameter of a fiber is to be measured 
under the microscope, a light background is needed; the 
scattered light against black gives a false impression of the 
size, since the actual outlines of the object cannot be seen. 
To put a conducting coat of metal on quartz, any one of 
several methods can be used. The simplest, and one which 
is satisfactory for fibers down to 20/j. in diameter, is to bake

the metal on, using any of the good china paints. Most of 
the noble metals — for example, platinum, gold, iridium, and 
so forth — can be obtained in this form. The paint is made by 
dissolving one of the metal salts in an organic liquid. China 
painters use this on their dishes and fire them to 700°C. 
The organic material disappears, and the metal compound 
decomposes, leaving behind a uniform coating of the metal. 
The thickness for each coat may vary from 0.05/x to 0.15^t, 
depending on the thickness of the original paint. Very 
adherent, electrically conducting coatings can be applied to 
glazed porcelain, glass, quartz, and so forth. The hot wire, 
held under small pieces of quartz fibers covered with these 
solutions, will bake them in a few seconds. If an attempt is 
made to treat small fibers in this way, it will be found that 
the solution collects into small drops along the fiber, and a 
disconnected coating results when it is baked. 

Sputtering or evaporating the metal on are the most satis- 
factory methods and have the advantage that conducting 
coats can be applied to fibers of any size. In general it is 
desirable to arrange to coat the fibers on all sides. Evapora- 
tion is the easier and simpler of the two methods. (See Chap- 
ter III.) A suitable apparatus for this is shown in Fig. 9. 

In working quartz it is absolutely necessary to use dark 
glasses to protect the eyes. Besides the brilliant glow, which 
in itself is bad for the eyes, the light is very rich in ultra- 
violet, which is especially harmful and may cause blindness 
through long exposure. The glasses should be gray in color, 
preferably, and have a transmission of from 10 to 20 per cent. 
Ordinary glass will cut out the ultraviolet, so that inexpensive 
dark glasses will suffice. 

The writer has used for some time a set of three micro- 
manipulators. Each has a three-jointed arm, which allows 
complete freedom in determining the position of the fiber. 
For fine adjustment, micrometer screws with divided heads 
give accurate motion in three mutually perpendicular di- 
rections. The accompanying illustration, Fig. 10, shows 
one of the three manipulators.

measurements to be made. Lighting from several direc- 
tions is desirable to provide proper illumination on the work 
in all positions. 

A complete setup of the major equipment used by the 
writer in quartz fiber work is illustrated in Fig. 11. The 
black glass base permits the fine fiber to be seen easily by 
scattered light. When the actual outlines of large fibers

Making fibers. A convenient size of stock quartz rod is 
3 to 4 mm in diameter. Smaller rod than this is apt to break 
when the larger fibers are being drawn and is not easily held 
in the hands. Larger rod becomes more difficult to melt. 

The first step in making a fine fiber is to draw one from 50/x 
to 100/u in diameter. (See Fig. 12.) Two pieces of stock

quartz of convenient length are held in the hands. The 
oxygen-gas flame is adjusted to maximum heat; that is, 
both the oxygen and gas are increased, especially the oxygen, 
until a hissing flame results, and the small cone just over the 
opening in the torch tip has shortened until its height is 
perhaps two or three times its width. The hottest portion 
of the flame is just above this small cone. The ends of the 
quartz rod are melted together and then pulled apart a short 



206 



THE USE OF FUSED SILICA 



[Chap. V 



distance, so that the connecting soft quartz is perhaps 1 mm 
in diameter. This portion, when held in the hottest part 
of the flame, will become quite soft. The quartz rods are 
then quickly removed from the flame, and at the same time 
the two pieces held in the hands are separated rapidly to a 

distance of several feet. 
The hotter the narrow sec- 
tion of quartz and the faster 
the drawing, the smaller 
will be the resulting fiber. 
Fibers down to 20/* can be 
drawn in this manner. 

To make a smaller fiber 
from the larger one, the 
procedure is as follows: 
Break the connecting fiber 
produced in the above 
drawing process so that a 
section of 8 to 10 inches is 
left on each piece of quartz 
stock. This section should 
be stiff enough to support 
itself in a vertical position. 
Now adjust the flame by 
turning the oxygen par- 
tially off, so that a steady 
flame about 15 to 20 inches 
long is produced. The cone 
above the tip will lengthen 
to several inches. Holding 
the quartz stock so that the attached fiber is vertical, move 
it into the vertical flame as illustrated in Fig. 13. The 
whole length of the fiber will glow uniformly. If the tem- 
perature of the flame and the size of the fiber are right, the 
fiber will gradually begin to lengthen, slowly at first and then 
more rapidly as it becomes smaller. Finally, the upper sec- 
tion of the original fiber will go quickly toward the ceiling. 




Fig. 13. The second step in making a 
small fiber is to blow out the larger fiber 
by holding it in a long, vertical, relatively 
cool flame. 



Chap. V] THE USE OF FUSED SILICA 207 

As soon as this happens, the lower end should be removed 
from the flame. A careful examination will reveal a fine 
fiber joining the two ends of the original, perhaps 3 to 6 feet 
long. Sections of it can be seen in scattered light. Place 
a small tab on one part of the fine fiber with one hand while 
holding the stock quartz (to which the other end of the fiber 
is attached) in the other. The position of the intervening 
portion is now determined, so that other tabs can be stuck 
on and suitable lengths removed. Each end of each length 
will thus have a small tab attached. These fibers are then 
stored in a clean container in which the air is kept dry. 
(See Fig. 14.) 

The size of the resulting small fiber will depend on a num- 
ber of factors. Chief among these are the size of the original 
fiber, the temperature and size of the flame, and the time 
intervening between the disappearance of the top of the 
original fiber and the removal of the lower end. Some 
practice is necessary to secure fibers of a desired size. It will 
be found that fibers produced in the above manner are 
straight and of quite uniform diameter for some distance 
on each side of the center. 

A few cautions are necessary if good fibers are to be had. 
The basis of all of these is cleanliness. Much of the dust on 
objects around a laboratory and floating in the air is inor- 
ganic. If a fiber is heated where a piece of dust has settled, 
the metallic salts form silicates and in general completely 
spoil the surface, and for that reason the fiber also, at the 
point of contact. It is a general rule that no part of a fiber 
which ultimately is to have any stress applied should ever 
touch anything except those materials which are softer than 
the quartz and will not react with it. This may seem to be 
a stringent requirement, but in reality the fiber can always be 
handled by its ends, which are eventually discarded. 

If the original large fiber shows any bright spots when put 
into the flame, it should be discarded. In general, this is the 
best test for dust that can be applied. Dust will immediately 
show itself by causing a bright spot, and the fiber can be 



208 THE USE OF FUSED SILICA [Chap. V 

discarded forthwith; if there is no dust on the fiber, it will 
not be harmed by heating. This test can be made with fi- 
bers from 10 fi to 100,u with an ordinary Bunsen burner. 
For smaller ones the small torch using a pure gas flame should 
be used. In each case the fiber should be under some ten- 
sion to keep it straight. 

If the size of the fiber is to be measured with the micro- 
scope, it is usually sufficient to take a sample from each end 
and take the mean diameter. The sample is placed on a 
piece of glass, which in turn is placed on the microscope 
stage and viewed by transmitted light. To find the fiber in 
the microscope the following procedure is valuable in saving 
time: Have plenty of light passing through the optical 
system. Raise the objective until it is several times the 
working distance from the object. Remove the ocular. 
Move the glass on which the fiber is lying until, by looking 
down the microscope tube, the reduced image of the fiber is 
seen. Adjust the position of the fiber until its image ap- 
pears approximately in the middle of the objective. Now 
move the objective down until the image begins to spread. 
When it appears to cover the objective completely, the ob- 
ject is near the focus, and on replacing the ocular, the image 
should be in the field of view. 

After working with fibers for a while, one can judge their 
size by the amount of scattered light, the amount of weaving 
in the air, how much a fiber of a given length sags under its 
own weight, the radius of curvature when hung over a needle 
with a tab on one end, and so forth. These methods are 
good to from 20 to 50 per cent, except for fibers below lfj, 

to 2[X. 

Another method for drawing fibers has been described 
by Boys. 7 It consists in pulling the two pieces of quartz 
apart very rapidly by means of a projected arrow. Long 
fibers down to lOfj. of very uniform diameter can be produced 
in this fashion. The hotter the quartz and the faster the 
arrow is shot, the finer will be the fiber.

The care and preservation of small fibers. When a fiber 
has its two ends marked with tabs, it should be hung in a 
clean, dry container. A crosspiece at the top of the con- 
tainer, on which are small pieces of soft wax or beeswax, 
serves as a hanger. The top tab is pressed into the wax, 
and the lower tab keeps the fiber from weaving around and 
touching things. 

The container should be 10 to 12 inches deep, airtight, 
and preferably made from glass. It should be clean and 
contain a good drying agent 
— either phosphorous pen- 
toxide or anhydrous potassi- 
um hydroxide. A convenient 
container is made from an in- 
verted bell jar with a plate- 
glass top as shown in Fig. 14. 
Fibers deteriorate in moist 
atmospheres, but can be pre- 
served for months with no 
change in breaking strength 
if kept clean and dry. 

Some useful techniques 
in fiber work. Straightening. 
Fibers from 10/x to 500/t can 
be quickly and easily straight- 
ened by hanging a weight on the lower end and running a 
Bunsen burner flame up and down the piece several times. 
The weight should be somewhat less than that necessary to 
elongate the fiber appreciably under the heat of the flame. 
A small Dennison tab is sufficient for fibers 10/t to 50/x and a 
f-inch tab for those between 50/t and 500/*. For fibers 
from 4/* to 10/* a small Dennison tab should be cut in two 
and the small torch burning pure gas used for heat. 

Bending. Fibers from 40/t on up are best bent by hang- 
ing a weight such as a tab at one end, holding the fiber 
at the proper angle, and applying the heat locally with a 
small torch burning oxygen and gas. The piece between the

flame and the tab will fall to a vertical position as shown 
in Fig. 15. 

Fibers between 1(jl and 4G> are best bent over another 
piece of quartz. A weight such as part or all of a small tab 
or a small piece of wax bends the fiber over the larger piece 
of quartz (100 fj. or less). A pure gas flame applied with the 
small torch at the contact of the two fibers will bend the

smaller one over the larger. The flame should not be ap- 
plied longer than is necessary, or the two pieces of quartz 
are apt to stick together. 

Drawing and shrinking. If one end of a fiber is attached 
to a screw-controlled sliding mechanism, such as the movable 
prong fork described earlier, a portion of it may be readily 
drawn down to any desired size by applying a flame with the 
small torch and gradually screwing out one prong. 

Soft quartz has a high surface tension, and fibers tend to 
shrink when heated. The heating is done with the small 
torch. It is necessary to have a properly adjusted flame. 
A compromise must be made between a hot flame with swiftly 
rushing gases, which readily melts and blows the fibers 



Chap. V]

apart, and a cooler flame, which will not soften the quartz 
sufficiently. The ideal is reached when the tendency to blow 
away is overcome by the tendency to pull together due to 
surface tension. The fiber is heated in a slackened condition, 
and as the shrinkage proceeds it is fed by the movable prongs. 
A torch tip with a hole about 0. 1 mm in diameter is perhaps 
the best. With some practice a fiber may be locally enlarged 
to many times its previous diameter. (See Fig. 16.)

Joining one fiber to another. When the above technique 
has been learned, the joining of two fibers crossing one an- 
other becomes simple. Each shrinks to the common junc- 
tion, forming a joint which is stronger than any other portion. 
For this work it is necessary to use two of the forks with 
movable prongs, gradually feeding in the quartz as the joint 
grows in size. 

Joining a fiber to a larger piece of quartz. If the larger 
piece is too large to melt locally with the small torch, 
a "teat" is put on at the proper place with a larger torch 
and then drawn down to a fine point. The fiber, mounted 
on the fork, is placed next to this teat, and heat is applied 
to the teat. Upon softening, the larger piece of quartz draws 
the small fiber in by surface tension. Straightening of the 



212 



THE USE OF FUSED SILICA

fiber near the junction is done by heating with the small 
torch burning pure gas when the fiber is under a slight 
tension. 

With care, fibers as small as 1/x in diameter can be melted 
to other fibers or larger pieces of quartz. 

Drawing an oval fiber. The tip of each piece of the stock 
quartz is heated in the oxygen-gas flame so that only the

very end becomes soft. With the axes of the two pieces 
held parallel, the ends are brought together and immediately 
separated at right angles to the axes of the stock quartz, 
and at the same time they are removed from the flame. 
(See Fig. 17.) Only flat fibers larger than 30/x to 40/x can 
be produced in this fashion. They are useful in vibration 
types of pressure gauges in which the motion is to be limited 
to one plane. 



Chap. V] THE USE OF FUSED SILICA 213 

Drawing fiat tubing. In some cases quartz is useful in 
making the Bourdon type of pressure gauge. If a long piece 
of flat tubing is made into a spiral and a mirror and scale are 
used to measure the change in angle, such a gauge becomes 
an accurate means of measuring moderate pressures. One 
way to produce long pieces of elliptically shaped thin-walled 
tubing is tb use two large torches as cross-fires and to heat 
|- to f-inch quartz tubing without rotation. Heating should 
continue until the walls nearest the flame are quite soft. 
The tubing is removed from the flame and rapidly pulled to 
3 or 4 feet. If heating has not been sufficient, the elongated 
occluded bubbles will cause the resultant tubing to be brittle. 
It is, in fact, a good procedure to work the heated section by 
alternately enlarging and contracting it with internal 
pressure before drawing. The oval tubing is bent into the 
desired shape with a moderately hot flame. 

Making electrometer suspensions. Quartz fibers make ideal 
suspensions for electrometers. The most satisfactory way

electrometers. The whole is made from fused quartz, upon which is deposited 
a coating of metal, for example, gold or platinum. 

of making the suspensions consists in joining the ends of the 
fiber to two larger pieces of quartz by melting them together 
with a small torch. In many cases these larger pieces are 
bent into small hooks, and then the whole is made conducting 
by evaporating or sputtering gold or some other metal on it 
as represented in Fig. 18. In cases in which hooks cannot be 
used, the larger quartz is left straight and is cemented into 
place with a hard wax such as DeKhotinsky's. Contact is 
made by attaching a fine wire to the quartz with hard wax 
before the fiber is coated with the metal. The wire is later 
soldered to the metal pieces of the electrometer. 

The method of soldering the metal-coated fibers does not 
produce a suspension as permanent as with the methods 
described above. The gold is apt to amalgamate with the 



214 



THE USE OF FUSED SILICA

solder and result in a poor contact between the main portion 
of the fiber and the solder. 

Another method of fastening fibers to metal parts and at 
the same time making an electrical contact is to use colloidal 
graphite. A small drop is placed at the proper point, and 
in a short while the water will evaporate, leaving a strong 
conducting joint. 

Quartz is very convenient for making various types of 
electroscopes. It is not only good for the moving parts but 
is used uncoated for insulation. 8 

Mounting cross hairs in optical instruments. Fibers made 
from quartz surpass any other material for cross hairs. 
Owing to the refraction of the light by the fiber, it appears 
black as seen in a bright field. Its essential smoothness, 
freedom from dust, uniformity of size, straightness, and the 
fact that it can be drawn to any desired diameter make it 
especially valuable. 

The mounting is first prepared by melting hard wax onto 
it at the desired points. The fiber is mounted on a fork and

lowered into position. A hot wire brought near the wax 
where the stretched fiber rests will allow the fiber to sink in 
and become firmly attached. The various steps are illus- 
trated in Fig. 19. 

Torsion balance. For objects weighing less than 1 mg 
the torsion balance becomes very useful. It is not difficult 

8 See Chapter VI, "Electrometers and Electroscopes." 



Chap. V]

to make a balance having a sensitivity of 10~ 7 to 10~ 9 
g/div. without the use of mirrors or microscopes. A simple 
calculation will show the size of fiber necessary for the 
specific requirements. The crossarm should be statically 
balanced. The amount of twist of the fiber is conveniently 
read from a divided head. 

The balance may be calibrated by weighing on an analyti-

gauge copper, 2-mil nickel, or smaller if needed, and cutting 
from this piece samples of a given length. Usually ten 
samples will give a probable error of less than 1 per cent in 
the calibration. If the tension in the torsion fiber is kept 
constant with a quartz bow, it can be assumed with much 
accuracy that the twist is proportional to the weight. Since 
<j>r/l is the surface strain, where r is the radius of the torsion 
fiber, 4> the angle of twist in radians, and I the length twisted, 



216 THE USE OF FUSED SILICA [Chap. V 

and since the maximum value of this is about 0.05, the maxi- 
mum load which the balance can handle is easily computed. 
A simple design of such a torsion balance is shown in Fig. 20. 

If all the joints are made of fused quartz, there need be 
no fear of a changing "zero," since the limit of elasticity 
coincides with the breaking point. 

Other uses of quartz. Quartz rod or fiber is often used as 
a carrier of light — visible, ultraviolet, or infrared. In- 
ternal reflections keep the light inside the quartz and permit 
it to be led around corners, provided the corners are not too 
sharp. 

In many cases in which accuracy in maintaining shape or 
position is important, quartz finds a use. All metals change 
their dimensions with time, especially when under strain. 
This change can be lessened by thorough annealing, which 
consists in subjecting the metal alternately to temperatures 
above and below room temperature. In extreme cases this 
treatment may take days or weeks. Annealed fused quartz 
does not suffer from changes in dimensions, since the flow 
under strain is less than 10~ 3 of that for metals. 

Fused quartz is finding increasing uses in lamps of various 
kinds in which the transmission of ultraviolet light is im- 
portant. For the same reason many photoelectric cells 
are made from quartz. 

Although the above does not pretend to be an exhaustive 
list of the uses to which fused silica can be put, it is hoped 
that the reader will gain some idea of the usefulness of this 
material.
