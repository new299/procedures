CHAPTER IV 

Coating of Surfaces: Evaporation 
and Sputtering 

GLASS, quartz, and other nonmetallic substances may 
be coated in the laboratory with thin films of metal by 
the following processes : 

1. Burning on 

2. Chemical deposition 

3. Cathode sputtering 

4. Evaporation 

Each of these is characterized by certain restrictions and 
advantages. For example, the "burning-on" method is 
applicable only in cases where the glass can be heated; 
chemical silvering (and also coating with gold and copper 
from aqueous solution) cannot be applied to surfaces like 
rock salt which are attacked by water; sputtering is par- 
ticularly suitable for preparing films of the platinum metals ; 
and the evaporation process is suited to the application of 
aluminum films. 

Although deposits can be produced on metals as well as 
nonmetals by these processes, electroplating (not treated 
here) is usually the most practical for coating metals. 

Burning-on method. Glass may be coated with a thin 
film of metal by the burning-on process. The process is 
applicable for the noble metals, which are reduced by 
heating. The glass to be coated is covered with a layer of 
an oily solution of one of the metallic salts. When heat is 
applied, the oil burns away, and the salt is reduced, leaving a 
deposit of the metal. This deposit is formed in an adherent 

151

compact film by a final heating to the softening point of the 
glass. 

A solution for depositing platinum 1 is made as follows: 
Evaporate 100 cc of a 10 per cent H 2 PtCl 6 solution to 
dryness and dissolve it in a minimum quantity of absolute 
alcohol. Add this alcohol solution slowly to 6 cc of oil of 
lavender kept ice-cold. Finally, add some Burgundy pitch 
to give the mixture consistency, so that it will remain uniform 
when it is applied and the glass is slowly heated. 

Solutions for gold, silver, and iridium are available 
commercially. 

A platinum film burned onto porcelain may be electro- 
plated with copper and soldered, thus affording a method of 
making a vacuum-tight seal between metal and porcelain. 

Chemical silvering processes. 2 There are two widely 
used methods for chemical silvering. These are the Brashear 
method and the Rochelle salt method. The first is used to 
obtain thick coats on front-silvered mirrors which are to be 
frequently burnished, such as telescope mirrors. The Ro- 
chelle salt method, because its action is slower, is recom- 
mended for making partially silvered mirrors, such as inter- 
ferometer plates, which require a uniform thin film with a 
specified ratio of reflection and transmission. 

Cleaning. The silver film does not deposit well on con- 
taminated surfaces. Therefore, fats and other surface 
contaminations must be cleaned off the glass, so that the 
colloidal particles of silver suspended in the silvering solu- 
tion will adhere strongly to the glass to form a tenacious 
compact metallic film. Just as a greasy glass surface is 
difficult to wet with water, so a clean wet surface does not

readily take up greases, fats, and other contamination. 
Accordingly, once a surface is clean, it will stay clean, if it 
is kept under distilled water until it is immersed in the 
silvering solution. 

The first step in cleaning a mirror is to free the sides and 
back of it from rouge and all other contaminations. An ink 
eraser is ideal for the removal of such contaminations. The 
pumice or ground glass in the eraser has an abrasive action 
particularly suitable for this preliminary cleaning of non- 
optical surfaces. The polished face cannot be cleaned in 
this manner, but it is well to work the eraser well over the 
edge. 

The mirror is next washed all over with soap and water, 
or Aerosol 3 and water. Aerosol is preferred to soap, since 
it may be washed off the face of the mirror without leaving 
any residue. If soap is used, it should be rinsed off with 
rain water or, better yet, with distilled water. 

A mild and harmless abrasive action on the face of a mirror 
is sometimes necessary. This is obtained by rubbing it 
with a pad of wet cotton, to which some precipitated chalk is 
added. After a polished glass surface has been treated with 
chalk, the cleaning water should wet the whole mirror face 
and not draw back anywhere to leave dry areas. It may be 
necessary to repeat the chalk treatment several times. 

The mirror is next rinsed with water and swabbed with 
concentrated nitric acid, a powerful oxidizing agent which 
removes organic matter adsorbed on the glass. The swab 
for applying the acid is made by wrapping absorbent cotton

American Cyanamid and Chemical Corporation, Bridgeville (Pittsburgh), 
Pennsylvania. 

Duncan, R. A., Indust. and Engin. Chem., 26, 24 (1934). This article gives 
a description of new detergents of which Aerosol is an example. These deter- 
gents have in common the constitution of sulphonated organic compounds of 
high molecular weight. They have a neutral reaction, and their advantage 
over soap for washing mirrors lies in the fact that they may be used in neutral, 
caustic, or even acid solutions. Unlike soap, they form soluble compounds 
with magnesium and calcium ions, which are common in tap water. The 
detergent Dreft, obtainable at grocery stores, is also suitable for washing 




154 EVAPORATION AND SPUTTERING [Chap. IV 

on a glass rod and fastening it with cotton twine as shown in 
Fig. 1. Care is exercised in using the swab to prevent the 
end of the rod from coming in contact with the mirror face. 
This nitric acid treatment should be carried out in the con- 
tainer in which the mirror is to be silvered to avoid possible 
contamination later with oil from the hands when the mirror 
is handled. If it is necessary to handle the mirror, it is 
advisable to use rubber gloves. 

Cleaning solution (chromic and sulphuric acid mixture) 
may be used for cleaning glass, but it is not ordinarily

After being rinsed with tap water, the mirror is treated 
with a concentrated solution of stannous chloride. This is 
removed after a few minutes by a very thorough rinsing. 
All chloride ions must be washed away, first with tap water 
and finally with distilled water. The mirror can stand in 
the distilled water until the silvering begins. 

It is important in silvering to clean carefully all the recep- 
tacles and graduates used. A long stick with an ink eraser 
fastened to the end will be found helpful to remove water 
stains and other contaminations. 

Brashear's process. 4 The Brashear process is described 
graphically in Fig. 2. The three formulas for the reducing 
solution given there afford different ways to effect the same 
end. In the first formula the nitric acid slowly digests the 
table sugar, to yield the sugars dextrose and levulose. 
This requires time and so the solution must be aged before 
use. In the second formula this aging is accelerated by 
boiling, and the solution can be used as soon as it is cool.

In the third formula dextrose is used directly. The alcohol 
is a preservative, and it is not required for the second and 
third solutions unless they are to be stored, in which case 
the same proportion of alcohol is used as called for in the 
first formula. 

There is danger of an explosion after the fourth stage, in- 
dicated in Fig. 2. The formation of the explosive, fulminat- 
ing silver, is not particularly favored by the low concentration 
of solutions and moderate temperatures that obtain here, 
but these relatively weak solutions will give fulminate on 
warm days if they are allowed to stand. This compound ex- 
plodes on the slightest provocation when dry and sometimes 
when wet. Accordingly, all spent silver solutions should be 
rinsed down the sink at once. Goggles are recommended 
for safety. 

As soon as the reducing reagent is added, the silvering 
solution is poured over the mirror. Filtering is optional. 
The distilled water in which the mirror has been standing 
may or may not be poured off first. Soon after the reducer 
is added, the solution becomes dark brown and then black. 
After this, it gradually develops a muddy brown appearance. 
At this stage the deposit of silver on the mirror is already 
continuous or should soon become so. The container for 
the mirror and solution may be tipped from time to time to 
stir the solution and allow inspection of the surface. When 
the silver film covers the whole surface and as soon as black 
specks begin to settle on it, a light swabbing with a cotton 
pad is recommended. This rubbing must be delicate at first, 
but it may be more vigorous as the silver becomes thicker, 
the surface being inspected from time to time for bloom. 
Usually when the solution begins to clear, it is nearly spent, 
and since the possibility of bloom becomes greater at this 
stage, it is best to pour off the solution and rinse the mirror 
with distilled water. For a full silver coat, Brashear's pro- 
cess requires, on the average, from 6 to 10 minutes. 

If a bright light, such as the sun, is visible through the 
coat, it is too thin. In this case the mirror should be covered 



Chap. IV] EVAPORATION AND SPUTTERING 157 

with distilled water, and the chemical solution for a second 
coat prepared. Do not let the mirror dry between coats. 

After a satisfactory coat is obtained, the rinsed mirror is 
rubbed with a pad of cotton until it is dry. The silver 
is burnished with a burnishing pad (chamois skin tacked on 
a Shinola shoe-polishing pad) to "compact" the coat. It is 
then polished with a similar chamois pad charged with 
optical rouge. The rouge pad may also be used from time 
to time to burnish away tarnish which forms on the silver 
mirror. 

Rochelle salt process. 5 Two solutions are required for 
the Rochelle salt process. Solution A is made as follows: 
5 g of silver nitrate are dissolved in 300 cc of water and 
ammoniated, as in the Brashear process, so that the silver 
oxide precipitate formed at first is almost but not completely 
clear. In case it inadvertently becomes clear, it must be 
back-titrated with a dilute solution of silver nitrate, so that 
the liquid finally presents a distinct straw color. This is 
filtered and diluted with water to 500 cc. Solution B is 
made as follows : 1 g of silver nitrate is dissolved in 500 cc 
of water. It is then brought to a boil, and 0.83 g of Rochelle 
salt, dissolved in a little water, is added. The boiling is con- 
tinued until a gray precipitate is deposited. The solution 
is filtered hot and diluted to 500 cc. These solutions may 
be stored for a month or so if they are protected from light. 

To silver a mirror, solutions A and B are mixed, volume 
for volume, and poured at once into the silvering vessel. 
The quantity of solutions given above is sufficient for a 
thick film on a glass surface of 200 cm 2 area. The tempera- 
ture recommended for silvering is 20°C (68°F.). 

Silver is deposited slowly by the Rochelle salt process; an 
hour may be required for a thick deposit to form. Partial 
reflecting films are obtained as desired by withdrawing the 
glass from the solution at the appropriate time. The 
progress of the deposition may be judged from auxiliary

Physics, page 269. Boston: Ginn and Company, 1903. 



158 EVAPORATION AND SPUTTERING [Chap. IV 

glass plates, which are removed from time to time to deter- 
mine the progress of the coating on the main plates. Fig. 3 
illustrates a simple test for determining when the silver film 
is half -reflecting (for 45° incidence). 

Partial reflecting plates are washed with distilled water 
and dried. Afterward they are polished by a light brushing 
with an eiderdown powder puff charged with optical rouge, 
as recommended by Pfund. 

Silver films are protected from tarnishing by covers of 
filter paper that have been soaked with lead acetate solution 



Light source should be directly over edge of mirror

and dried. These covers are applied whenever the films are 
not actually in use. 

Lacquering. Another procedure for protecting the silver 
from tarnishing involves coating the film with a thin layer 
of colorless lacquer. The layer of lacquer destroys some of 
the reflectivity of the mirror, and in addition it exhibits 
interference colors. R. W. Wood has pointed out that a 
thin transparent film of lacquer on a good reflector should 
not show interference colors. 6 The colors usually exhibited 
by a lacquer film are due to frilling. This frilling can be 
observed directly only with the highest-power microscopes. 
Wood states that no frilling occurs and that there are, 
accordingly, no interference colors if collodion dissolved in 
chemically pure redistilled ether is used to lacquer the mirror.

In order to obtain uniform lacquer films with the ether 
solution of collodion, it is necessary that the ether evaporate 
slowly. The can illustrated in Fig. 4 is suggested for use in

Sputtering. Although the sputtering phenomenon at 
the cathode of a glow discharge has been known for a long 
time, 9 the mechanism of the process is not fully understood 
even now. 10 There are two current theories of sputtering. 
One of these holds that the emission of metal by the cathode 
is pure thermal evaporation due to high temperatures at- 
tained in areas of molecular dimensions. These tempera-

160 EVAPORATION AND SPUTTERING [Chap. IV 

tures are produced by the energy of impinging ions. The 
other theory invokes a mechanism for transferring the energy 
of the gas ion into energy of a metal molecule which is 
similar to the mechanism by which the energy of a light 
quantum is transformed to energy of an emitted electron. 
However, in spite of its being incompletely explained, 
sputtering is understood empirically, and its practical appli- 
cation for obtaining metal films on glass is simple. 

Sputtering can be carried out successfully under a wide 
variety of conditions. For example, the pressure of the 
glow discharge may range from 1 down to 10 -2 mm. The 
cathode is naturally made of the metal to be sputtered, al- 
though its shape may vary considerably. The anode is 
usually aluminum or iron. The glow discharge is prefer- 
ably produced by a direct potential, although an alternating 
potential can be used. The- potential usually ranges above 
1000 volts and frequently is as high as 20,000 volts. The 
residual gas in the sputtering chamber may be air, hydrogen, 
argon, or other gases. (The sputtering rate with helium is 
extremely low, and this gas is used for glow discharges where 
sputtering is to be avoided.) The surface to be sputtered 
is usually placed tangent to the boundary of the cathode 
dark space, although it may lie within or beyond it. The 
low pressure required can be obtained with a mechanical 
pump of small capacity on a tight system or with a faster 
mechanical or diffusion pump on a system equipped with a 
regulating leak. 

A typical setup for the sputtering process is shown in 
Fig. 5. The sputtering chamber is usually a glass bell jar 
with a hole in the top for the cathode connection. It may 
be made from an old bottle with the bottom cut out and the 
base ground fiat. It is best to have a glass plate for the 
base, although a metal one (preferably iron) will suffice. An 
aluminum plate can be used to cover any exposed metal 
parts which may give trouble by sputtering. It is advisable 
to heat all aluminum before it is used in order to drive off the 
machine oils which may be contained in it. Glass cylinders

and plates, as shown in Fig. 5, are useful for confining the 
discharge. If these plates and cylinders are not used, the 
outgassing induced by the discharge may give rise to foreign 
substances deleterious to the film produced. 

The cathode is fitted in the top of the bell jar as shown. 
It is pulled up against the square end of the depending glass 
tube by the connector wire. This wire is secured by wrap- 
ping it around the top end of the tube, where it is sealed with 
wax (Apiezon "W," shellac, or DeKhotinsky wax). 

Batteries or motor-generator sets are ideal sources for 
the sputtering potential, but other sources of potential are 
often employed. An induction coil makes a convenient 
source of potential, giving partially rectified current. How- 
ever, alternating current from a 10,000-volt neon-sign 
transformer can be used. It is advisable but not necessary 
to rectify the current from this transformer with a Kenetron 
rectifier. 

The use of a milliammeter to measure the discharge 
current is advisable when making partially transmitting 
coats. When the sputtering equipment has been calibrated, 
this current serves as an index to determine proper exposure 
for obtaining a desired ratio of transmission and reflection. 
The sputtering rate can be controlled, for example, by ad- 
justing the filament current of the Kenetron. The rate of 
sputtering increases a little more than linearly with the 
sputtering current, depending somewhat upon the condi- 
tions of temperature, pressure, and geometry which obtain. 
For work in which high reproducibility in the film thickness 
is required, it is advisable to use a fast pump and to wash the 
bell jar continuously with air or hydrogen. Inasmuch as 
the first part of the sputtering may be erratic and the dis- 
charge unsteady, it is well to cover the mirror with mica 
until sputtering has definitely started and become stable. 
This mica is mounted on pivots with an attached iron arma- 
ture, so that it can be operated with the help of a magnet 
through the walls of the bell jar; or it may be operated by 
tipping the whole system. 



Chap. IV] EVAPORATION AND SPUTTERING 



163 



The pressure for sputtering is usually adjusted so as to 
give a dark space of about the same length as the distance 
of the mirror from the cathode. 

The cathode should be shaped so that the boundary of 
the dark space is roughly parallel to the mirror surface. 
For flat or nearly flat mirrors the cathode is made flat, 
while for strongly curved mirrors it should be correspond- 
ingly curved. A U-shaped sheet cathode can be used for 
coating the two sides of a plate at once, and a central wire 
cathode can be used to coat the inside of tubes, provided 
that their length is not much greater than their diameter. 
Conversely, a cylindrical cathode can be used for coating 
fibers on all sides at once and for coating the outside of 
tubes. 

The gas admitted, when fast pumps are used, may be air, 
hydrogen, or argon. Hydrogen is preferred by some even

silicon. Optical films of these metals were produced in less 
than 15 hours in this vapor. Good but not entirely opaque 
optical films of beryllium were obtained after sputtering for 
60 hours in hydrogen and mercury vapor. 

Clean dry surfaces and breath figures. To get a surface 
both clean and dry as required for sputtering and evapo- 
ration is a great deal more difficult than to clean it for chemi- 
cal silvering as described above. Most surfaces cleaned 
and then dried with absorbent cotton or a towel are found to 
condense the breath in a gray film. The reason is that in 
the drying process the glass surface becomes coated with a 
layer of contamination, which is probably a monomolecular 
film of fatty acid gathered from the cotton. Water con- 
denses on such a film in tiny droplets, while on a really clean 
surface it condenses in an invisible uniform film. 

Surfaces can be chemically cleaned and dried in a des- 
iccator. Such surfaces give a continuous deposit when 
breathed on. Also, surfaces may be dried with linen without 
contaminating them, as Wm. B. Hardy has succeeded in 
doing. Hardy found it necessary, however, to use linen 
from which the oily compounds had been extracted with 
pure benzene. 

However, a method to remove the contamination picked 
up from the towel when the mirror is dried is more practical 
than to depend upon successfully avoiding such contamina- 
tion. This dry cleaning can be effected by the action of ions. 

The study of this action of ions on the surface of glass 
started with Aitken and Lord Rayleigh. 12 They found that 
when the tip of a blowpipe flame was passed quickly over the 
surface of the glass, it cleaned the surface and produced a 
so-called breath figure; that is, if one breathed on the glass, 
the moisture condensed in a gray film of fine droplets, except 
that where the flame had traversed the surface, the moisture 
condensed in the form of a continuous "black" film. T. J. 
Baker and others have carried the study of breath figures

further. 13 For example, Baker found that they were pro- 
duced only by the hotter flames, which are rich in ions. 
Among the interesting phenomena revealed by his investi- 
gation was that breath figures could also be produced by 
sparks, and that, curiously, they could be transferred from 
one glass plate to another if the two plates were held together 
but not quite in contact. He also discovered that the black 
area is a relatively good conductor of electricity and that the 
coefficient of friction between glass and glass was very high 

in the black area. Fig. 7

fractured glass surface condenses moisture in a continuous 
black film. 

As a parallel to Pollard's discovery, it was found that alu- 
minum coats prepared by evaporation in vacuum adhere so 
tenaciously to areas that have been flamed that they cannot 
be removed by stripping Scotch tape off the film, although 
the tape removes the aluminum from regions not traversed 
by the flame. 16 Also, the black type of condensation, as 
well as good adhesion of an aluminum film, occurs after a 
glass surface is exposed to sparks at atmospheric pressure or 
to a glow discharge at reduced pressure. The explanation

of all these phenomena is that the ions of the hotter flames, 
sparks, or glow discharges clean the surface of the glass. 

The practices adopted to effect a final cleaning of a glass 
surface are either to expose it to the brush discharge from 
the electrode of a high-frequency transformer at atmos- 
pheric pressure or to expose the glass to a glow discharge in 
an evaporation chamber while it is being evacuated. 

Cleaning mirrors for aluminizing. When aluminum is 
deposited on a glass surface which is not adequately cleaned, 
the adhesion will be inferior 
to that exhibited by a coat on 
a properly cleaned surface. 
In most cases the mirror will 
look good at first but will 
develop countless tiny blisters 
after standing a day or so. 

The first phases of the clean- 
ing procedure for aluminizing 
are like those for chemical sil- 
vering. The preliminary 
cleaning with the rubber eraser 
is carried out with particular 
thoroughness. Small bubble holes in the face of the mirror 
that contain rouge and pitch from the figuring should be 
ground out with emery as shown in Fig. 8. If the rouge 
and pitch in small bubble holes is not removed, the towel 
used for drying the mirror may pick up some of the pitch and 
spread it over the surface of the mirror face in layers too 
thick to be removed by electrical cleaning. 

After the glass has been cleaned and rinsed as described 
above for silvering, it is dried with clean cotton towels. 
It is well to use old cotton towels, because after many 
launderings they become more absorbent and contain less 
fatty substances than absorbent cotton. Care is exercised 
to avoid contaminating the freshly laundered towel by 
touching it with the hands in the areas to be used to dry 
the mirror face.

Finally, the glass is exposed to a glow discharge during the 
evacuation. 

Evaporation. The evaporation method for producing 
thin films on glass, quartz, and so forth, is simple both in its 
mechanism and in its practical application. A small piece 
of the metal (or nonmetal, for that matter) is simply heated 
in a high vacuum until its vapor pressure is about 10 -2 mm 
of mercury or greater, whereupon it emits molecular rays in 
all directions. The degree of vacuum required for success- 
fully carrying out the process is such that the mean free 
path of the molecules is larger than the diameter of the 
vacuum container. Therefore molecular rays propagate 
from their source without disturbance until they impinge on 
the walls of the vacuum or some object within them. The 
mirror surface to be coated is exposed to these molecular 
rays, which condense on it to form the desired film. An 
interesting feature of the condensed film is that it apparently 
exhibits the same degree of polish as the underlying glass 
and so requires no subsequent burnishing, as does chemical 
silvering. Also, this film forms without material heating of 
the mirror. 

Although the evaporation method was known by 1912, it 
remained obscure, for some reason, long after it should have 
become a practical "tool" in the laboratory. 16 Among the 
items which have influenced its recent rather extensive 
applications are the development of a bare tungsten heater 
technique, 17 the adaptability of the process to nonmetals and 
for the application of aluminum, 18 and the development 
of high-speed vacuum pumps. (See Chapter III.) 

Whether or not a particular material is suited to giving 
films by the evaporation process is determined by the 
thermal stability and vapor pressure of the material and 
the practicality of bringing the material to the evaporation 
temperature in vacuum.

Most of the metals melt first before they evaporate, the 
molten metal being kept from falling out of the coil by sur- 
face tension. 

Other metals, like magnesium, sublime. Of these, some 
sublime very slowly, because the metal will not fuse to the 
tungsten wire in vacuum. Chromium affords an example. 
The evaporation of such a metal is managed as follows: 
It is first brought to fusion temperature in the tungsten 
coil in an atmosphere of hydrogen or helium. These gases

facilitate heat transfer between tungsten and the chromium 
or other metal, and, in addition, they restrain evaporation 
of the metal. (See Fig. 9.) After intimate contact with the 
tungsten wire is established, the metal will then sublime

faster in the vacuum, because the heat is transmitted to it 
more effectively. An alternate way of attaining the same 
end is to electroplate the chromium or other metal onto the 
tungsten coil. 19 The metals best managed by the above 
procedures include, besides chromium, the platinum metals 
and beryllium. 

Frequently, it is desirable to prefuse a metal which other- 
wise sublimes, in order to free it from included impurities. 

Such metals as calcium, mag- 
nesium, and cadmium can be 
prefused in helium to outgas 
them and to prepare them 
for evaporation.

metals, and aluminum. In spite of this, it is possible to 
evaporate them for the preparation of small laboratory 
mirrors. 

Fig. 10 shows a neat simple insulated support for wires 
in vacuum. 

Evaporation technique for aluminum. The technique 
for evaporation of aluminum from tungsten coils is of special 
interest, since this metal is important for surfacing where 
high ultraviolet and high visible reflectivity are desired in 
combination with freedom from tarnishing. 

Pringsheim and Pohl discovered that several metals 
(including aluminum) could be evaporated in vacuum and 
condensed on a glass surface to form a polished reflecting 
film. They used a magnesia crucible from which to distill 
the metal. 20 R. Ritschl, in 1928, in making an application of 
the evaporation method to the preparation of half-silvered 
interferometer mirrors, heated the silver in a bare tungsten 
coil. 21 This change in technique has the advantage that the 
tungsten does not evaporate or outgas so much in a vacuum 
as does the magnesia crucible. 

Following this, Cartwright and Strong developed a simple 
apparatus for carrying out the evaporation process in the 
laboratory and made a survey of its applicability to different 
metals. 22 The usual technique, in which the metal to be 
evaporated was heated in a helix of tungsten wire, was found 
successful, except with the metals aluminum and beryllium, 
which dissolved the tungsten coil. 

Other attempts were made to develop this technique of 
evaporating aluminum. 23 Experiments were carried out 
with crucibles of graphite, pure fused magnesia, and alumina 
(sapphire), as well as with sintered and fused crucibles of 
thorium oxide. These experiments showed that heating in a 
crucible was apparently impractical, since either the metal

reacted chemically with the material of the crucible or the

The discovery that tung- 

mondrel -S/,6 "ound Q 4" long gten hag & li m j te( J solubility 

in molten aluminum led to 
the bare tungsten method of 
evaporation — the most prac- 
ticed of all the methods. 24 

A chemical analysis of the 
tungsten alloy that is 
formed when aluminum is 
fused on a tungsten coil 
showed the solubility of 
tungsten in aluminum to be 
about 3 per cent by volume. 
Accordingly, the burning out 
of the tungsten wire may be 
avoided by the simple expe- 
dient of making it of rela- 
tively large diameter and ar- 
ranging the charge so that the solubility of the molten alumi- 
num for tungsten can be satisfied without dangerously reduc- 
ing the diameter of the wire. 

It might be expected that 
some of the dissolved tungsten 
would boil away, especially 
since its spectrum has been 
observed during evaporation. 25 
In order to test this point, 
a coil was weighed before 
and after evaporating several 
charges of aluminum. Instead 
of a loss in weight, an in- 
crease was observed, indicat- 
ing that some aluminum had

diffused into the tungsten. However, extended heating in 
vacuum at a very high temperature decreased the weight, 
until, within the experimental error, it became the same as 
in the beginning. A chemical analysis of the condensed 
metal film was made to test whether or not tungsten is 
evaporated. The analysis gave no definite indication of 
tungsten. A concentration of 0.03 per cent by weight was

detectable. The tungsten which is dissolved thus appears to 
be almost completely precipitated back onto the coil as the 
evaporation proceeds. Although it may not be deposited 
back in exactly the same place, it does compensate in a large 
measure for the decrease in diameter of the tungsten wire. 
The arrangement used at first for aluminizing mirrors at 
the California Institute of Technology is shown in Figs. 11 
and 12. It is in the form of a helix, consisting of 10 turns of 
30-mil tungsten wire, -^ of an inch in diameter and pitched 



174 



EVAPORATION AND SPUTTERING [Chap. IV 



4 turns to the inch. A U-shaped piece of aluminum wire 
1 mm in diameter and about 10 mm in total length is 
clamped to each turn as is shown in Fig. 11. A potential 
of 20 volts applied to the coil in vacuum for 4 seconds pref uses 
these pieces as shown in Fig. 12. At this stage, surface 
tension keeps the molten aluminum from dropping. This 
prefusion also serves to free the metal from oxide and other 
impurities. It is customary to make a separate run in 
order to effect this fusing of the aluminum to the tungsten

wires. In the 40-inch tank (see Fig. 13), however, the coils 
are covered by a baffle during the preliminary firing. The 
aluminum is finally distilled from the coils by applying the 
same voltage to each coil for about 15 seconds. 

Actually, the aluminum does not evaporate from the 
fused metal but from the adjacent tungsten wire. This is 
clearly shown by the "self-photograph" of the filament re- 
produced in Fig. 14. This "self -photograph" was recorded 
on glass with the molecular rays of aluminum passing 
through a pinhole. 

A recently developed evaporation source allows a much

higher rate of evaporation of aluminum with less tendency 

to burn out or drop molten aluminum. The new source 

uses three or four 20-mil tungsten wires twisted together as 

shown in Fig. 15. The metal 

charge, applied as illustrated in 

Fig. 11, flows out to fill the space 

between the wires when heat is 

applied. The aluminum covers 

the tungsten completely, so that 

a minimum "ratio" of heat radi- 
ation to molecular radiation of 

aluminum is achieved. 

Fig. 16 shows the form by which 

the new source is applied to the 

evaporation of gold. When the 

gold melts in the "cup," it is 

drawn out to coat the tungsten and 

it fills up the spaces between wires 

from one end to the other. 

For evaporation of silver and 

copper the source should be 

made from molybdenum rather 

than tungsten, as the latter 

metal is not easily wet with silver and copper. 

For evaporation of the platinum metals, a unit similar to 

the one shown in Fig. 15 is made up of three 20-mil tungsten 

wires and one platinum metal wire of the same diameter. 

The "ratio" of heat to metal 
radiated is a minimum. 
Furthermore, the awkward 
process of electroplating the 
platinum on the filament is 
avoided. The evaporation 
should proceed slowly, even 

from this source, because if too much current is applied, the 

evaporation is no longer smooth, and globules of metal are 

discharged from the source.

Chromium is easily evaporated from a source like the one 
shown in Fig. 16. A piece of the metal is put in the "cup" 
and is preheated in an atmosphere of hydro- 
gen or helium to fuse it and distribute it over 
the tungsten. Various other evaporation 
sources are illustrated in Figs. 17 to 20.

one shown in the previous chapter.

The cleaning electrode 
shown in Fig. 13 allows the

the mirror, to be filled with

discharge effects the final 
cleaning of the mirror face. 

It is recommended that the 
aluminum be evaporated 
soon after a nonconducting 
vacuum has been reached, in 



29 Strong, J., Astrophys. J., 83, 401 (1936). 

Metal tanks of seamless steel are available from the Eclipse Fuel Engineering 
Company (Los Angeles agent, James H. Knopf) in the same form as bell jars. 
After the foot is machined, they are suitable for sealing to a base plate to form 
a good vacuum container for evaporation. It is advisable to clean the tank 
inside and out by sand blasting and to coat it inside with Apiezon wax "W" 
and outside with Glyptal lacquer. 



Chap. IV] EVAPORATION AND SPUTTERING 177 

order to obtain maximum tenacity between the aluminum 
film and the glass. Also, this procedure yields harder films. 

Uniform films. In order to obtain a uniform coat on 
large mirrors, aluminum is evaporated from several tungsten 
sources suitably arranged, rather than from one movable 
source. 

The evaporation of polonium in a high vacuum from a 
point source has been investigated by Bon6t-Maury. 27 
This metal was chosen on account of its radioactivity. He 
found that the condensation on a plane sur- 
face is proportional to the inverse square of f^l [ iifl 
the distance from the source, and to the jj ;^~! 

cosine of the angle between the normal to II ; vFj 

the surface and the line connecting the sur- ^ \^ ^S«* 
face with the source. We may assume that tantalum cap to

Starting with this assumption, we may metal*/ ° r 
consider the distribution of the film thick- Fi 20

arrangements. In the case of evaporation to the inside 
surface of a sphere of radius p from a point source of vapor 
at its center, the situation is very simple. We get a uni-

For convenience, the radius of the circular source is here 
taken as unity. We see from this table that for p = 1 the 
film is quite uniform as far out from the center as a — 1. 
This case was realized in the 40-inch aluminizing tank by a 
circular array of twelve of the standard coils (see Fig. 12) 
spaced around a circle 36 inches in diameter, 18 inches above 
the face of the astronomical reflector to be coated (Fig. 22). 
Tests of transmission of a film produced with partially loaded 
coils confirmed the calculation, since the coat exhibited the 
expected uniformity.

180 EVAPORATION AND SPUTTERING [Chap. IV 

In a larger 108-inch tank it was not convenient to use a 
similar array of coils spaced 50 inches from the face of the 
mirror. Instead, three arrays were used, each about 20 
inches from the mirror. The arrangement is shown in 
Fig. 22. From the expressions developed above, as well 
as from actual tests, it was found that four coils in the 
center, twelve on a circle of 50 inches in diameter, and 
twenty-four on a circle of 100 inches in diameter gave the 
proper loading. This arrangement produced a uniform 
film of proper thickness on a 100-inch mirror, the film being 
just a little thicker than that required to be opaque to sun- 
light. It is desirable to have this thickness (about 1000 A), 
since much thicker films are more easily scratched, while 
thinner ones may in time become transparent as a result of 
the gradual growth of thickness of the oxide layer which 
forms on the aluminum coat. 

Parabolizing a spherical mirror with aluminum. As soon 
as the technique for the attainment of uniform films was 
perfected, it became possible to prepare nonuniform films, 
with the thickness of the film varying in just the manner 
required to parabolize a spherical mirror. The difference 
r between the circle and parabola illustrated in Fig. 23 is 
given to close approximation by the expression 

t = y 2 (fo - y 2 )^- 3 > (6) 

where y is the ordinate and R is the radius of curvature of 
the circle. y represents the ordinate where the two curves 
intersect. The difference is zero at y = and at y = y 
and has a maximum at y = y /\ // 2. 

If a spherical mirror of diameter 2y (represented by the

(the surface generated by rotation of the parabola), it is

Inasmuch as it is possible to put down films of aluminum 
to 1/jt. thickness and greater, it is possible to parabolize a 
12-inch mirror //6, which requires a maximum thickness of 
only 0.34/i of aluminum. This is not an uncommon ex- 
ample encountered in astronomical mirrors.

The correct procedure for applying such a parabolizing 
film is first to compute the thickness and distribution of the 
aluminum film produced by a point source positioned op- 
posite the center of the mirror as shown in Fig. 24. This

can be done by the use of the formula given below for the

Here m is the total mass of aluminum evaporated, in grams, 
and d is the distance between the source and the point in 
question on the mirror face. 

A baffle of the shape illustrated by Fig. 25 is then cut from 
thin sheet brass and placed directly in front of the mirror as 
shown in Fig. 24. This baffle can be rotated, or, what is

more convenient, it may be fixed and the mirror rotated as 
shown in Fig. 24. The baffle is so designed as to modify 
the thickness which would 
otherwise be obtained (given 
by Eq. 9), so that it will con- 
form with that required by 
Eq. 6. The baffle will have 
zero angular opening at the 
center and edge and a maxi- 
mum opening very near to 
y = yo/V2. It is to be re- 
membered that the effect of 
the baffle in a given zone is 
to decrease the thickness by 
a factor which is the ratio of 
the quantities, 360° minus the angular opening of the baffle 
opposite the particular zone in question, to 360°. In order 
to avoid astigmatism, the mirror is rotated a great many 
times during the deposition. 

It is necessary, for some reason not yet clearly demon- 
strated, to evaporate slightly more aluminum than the simple 

theory outlined above pre- 
dicts. The procedure in this 
case is to deposit some metal 
(about the theoretical amount) 
and then test the mirror. On 
the basis of the Foucault test, 
an additional amount is 
evaporated, and so on until 
the required figure is obtained. 
If too much metal is added, 
the coat can be washed off 
with caustic soda. Usually 
the mirror can be finished 
on the second attempt. 
When several mirrors, all alike, are to be parabolized, this 
preliminary testing may be done once for all.

Sphere tested at its mean

Figs. 26, 27, and 28 show f ocograms of a mirror parabolized 
by this method. It was originally a sphere true to ^ of a 

wave length of green light, as 
the first focogram (Fig. 26), 
taken at its center of curva- 
ture, shows. This sphere was 
152| inches in radius of cur- 
vature. 2y was 12f inches. 
The next focogram, Fig. 27, 
shows it at its mean focus 
when tested with parallel 
light with the aid of a testing 
flat, obviously in need of para- 
bolizing to give a good knife- 
edge cutoff. After it was para- 
bolized with a coat of alumi- 
num, it appeared as shown in the third focogram, Fig. 28. 
Here, again, it exhibits a true figure of revolution, this time 
a parabola true to less than 2V of a wave length of green light. 

Mirrors imperfectly figured 
by conventional methods 
can be improved by this pro- 
cedure. In this case the baffle 
design is determined by a pre- 
liminary quantitative survey 
of the mirror with a knife- 
edge testing outfit. (See 
Chapter II.) 

It is possible to apply a thin 
film of aluminum to a convex 
sphere and transform it to a 
hyperbolic figure of revolution 
for use as the secondary mir- 
ror in a Cassegrain telescope. 

The formula for the difference between the hyperbola, or 
any conic of eccentricity e, and the sphere tangent to it at 
the center and touching it at the radius distance y is

Eq. 6 for the parabola is Eq. 10 when e = 1. To obtain a 
hyperbola, it is necessary to have the aluminum thick at 
center and edge with a minimum at y — y /\^2. The baffle 
to effect this is just the inverse of the one shown in Fig. 25, 
being open where the other is opaque and vice versa. The 
further details of the process are described in a paper by 
Strong and Gaviola and in the paper of Gaviola on the 
quantitative use of the knife-edge test. 29 

Partially reflecting films. Partially reflecting films of 
silver and aluminum are useful for dividing a beam of light 
in many optical instruments such as color cameras and inter- 
ferometers. 

Figs. 29 and 30 show the reflection and transmission char- 
acteristics of silver and aluminum films obtained by the

illustrate the color characteristics of the films and their 
efficiencies. They also indicate approximately the amount 
of metal to be evaporated to obtain any desired ratio of 
reflection to transmission. The curves for silver refer to

fresh deposits, whereas the curves for aluminum apply to 
films about 6 months old, which have more or less attained 
their equilibrium optical characteristics. 

The reproducibility with which any given film can be

unfortunately not very great. The variations to be expected 
are greater in the case of aluminum. 

The films from which the curves in Figs. 29 and 30 were 
obtained were evaporated with a vacuum of 1 to 5 X 
10 -5 mm, the mirror distance being 33 cm in the case of 
aluminum and 27 cm in the case of silver. A source like the 

one shown in Fig. 17 was used 
for silver. The metal was in 
the form of a 40-mil wire. 
A straight, horizontal 40- 
mil tungsten wire served as 
the evaporation source for 
aluminum as shown in Fig. 31. The metal was a weighed 
U-shaped piece of wire pinched onto the center of the 
tungsten wire. 

Silver films have a greater efficiency than aluminum films, 
and they are, accordingly, best for coating Farby and Perot 
interferometer plates. They may be protected from the

tarnishing gases in the atmosphere by a thin layer of cal- 
cium fluoride or quartz. 

The calcium fluoride (or quartz) films should be about 
j of a fringe in thickness. If a copper sheet is placed close 
to the evaporation source, it is possible to count the fringes 
as they are formed on this sheet by the evaporated calcium 
fluoride (or quartz). The square of the ratio of the distance 
of the copper to that of the silver gives the ratio of film 
thickness of calcium fluoride (or quartz) evaporated onto 
these two surfaces. The evaporation of calcium fluoride (or 
quartz) is stopped after an appropriate number of fringes 
have appeared on the copper. 

A thin film of aluminum on the silver will oxidize to a pro- 
tecting layer of aluminum oxide on exposure to the air. 
The proper amount of aluminum to be evaporated is about 
one-sixteenth the amount required to give a half -transmitting 
coat. Accordingly, the proper amount of aluminum may be 
gauged by means of an auxiliary glass plate positioned at 
one-fourth the silver film distance from the evaporation 
source. The proper amount of aluminum is evaporated 
when the film on the auxiliary glass plate appears to be about 
half -transmitting.
