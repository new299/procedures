CHAPTER VIII 

Vacuum Thermopiles and the Measurement 
of Radiant Energy 

BY 

C. Hawley Cartwright and John Strong 

4 RADIOMETRIC instrument consists of a blackened 
-^*- receiver, which is heated by the radiant energy to be 
measured. The instrument is provided with some physical 
means for measuring the rise in temperature of the receiver 
produced by the radiant energy. For the most delicate 
measurements the means employed must be responsive to a 
rise of temperature of the order of a few millionths of a 
degree. 

In comparison with other methods of measuring light 
intensity, a radiometric instrument is characterized by the 
direct and simple way in which the response depends on the 
intensity of the light; the relation between these two quanti- 
ties is linear. Also, the instrument is generally characterized 
by equal sensitivity for all wave lengths. 

For measuring the intensity of radiant energy at wave 
lengths less than l/x, radiometric instruments are more 
reliable but less sensitive than other instruments such as 
photoelectric or photographic photometers. Accordingly, a 
radiometric instrument is frequently used as a reference 
instrument for the calibration of photoelectric and photo- 
graphic photometers. In infrared spectroscopy, however, 
the radiometric instrument is the most sensitive instru- 
ment now available. 

When a radiometric instrument is giving its full response 
to a beam of light incident on the receiver, the rate at which 

305 



306 VACUUM THERMOPILES [Chap. VIII 

the heat is lost by the receiver is in equilibrium with the 
rate at which heat is absorbed from the light beam, 3>„. 
Inasmuch as the heat lost by the receiver is proportional to 
the produced rise in temperature, AT, we can write 

* a = L X AT + UAT + LsAT + UAT, (1) 

where the L's represent the heat losses in unit time per unit 
temperature change. Thus, Li represents the loss of heat 
by radiation from the receiver, L 2 the loss by air conduction, 
L 3 the loss by conduction through members touching the 
receiver, and L 4 any other means of losing heat, such as, in 
the case of a thermopile, Peltier heat loss. Obviously, it 
is desirable to have the L's small, and for this reason the 
energy is to be concentrated onto a small receiver to reduce 
L\. Furthermore, the receiver is usually mounted in a 
high vacuum in order to make L 2 vanish. 

The response of the instrument is determined by the mag- 
nitude of AT, and different radiometric instruments are 
characterized by the manner in which AT 1 is measured. 

A thermopile measures AT" by means of one or more 
thermoelectric junctions attached to the receiver. 1 

A microradiometer measures AT in the same manner as 
a thermopile. 2 In this instrument, however, the thermo-

junctions and receiver are attached to the moving system of 
a galvanometer coil, which is suspended on a fine quartz 
fiber. The superiority of the microradiometer over a 
thermopile lies in the fact that, because no outside lead 
wires are required, energy losses in electrical resistance are 
diminished. However, the combination of the thermopile 
and galvanometer makes an instrument which is awkward to 
use in a spectrometer, because it must be protected from 
vibration in its operating position. 

A bolometer consists of a blackened thin metal strip 
with electrical connections. 3 This strip forms the receiver 
for the radiations. It is connected as one arm of a balanced 
Wheatstone bridge. The change in the electrical resistance 
of the strip, as measured by a sensitive bridge galvanometer, 
is a measure of AT. 

A radiometer consists of a system composed of a receiver 
and a mirror which is mounted in a partially evacuated case. 
The system is suspended by a fine quartz fiber. The back of 
the receiver is thermally insulated from the front, so that 
when a beam of light falls on the receiver, the front is heated 
more than the back. 4 

The radiometer is most sensitive at a gas pressure of 
about 0.06 mm of mercury. The gas molecules which strike 
the side of the receiver which is warmed by the radiations 
leave it with a greater velocity than those which strike the 
opposite and cooler side, and therefore a net backward re- 
coil is exerted. This results in a deflection of the system 
until the recoil torque is balanced by the torque arising from

torsion of the quartz fiber. The deflection of the system, 
as indicated by the mirror, is a measure of the temperature 
difference, AT, between the front and back surfaces of the 
receiver. 

Anyone interested in radiometers will find some of the 
important papers on this subject listed in the footnotes. 
One of the features of the radiometer is its constant sensi- 
tivity. This reproducibility of the deflection is due partly 
to the use of a quartz suspension but mostly to the fact that 
the required pressure (0.06 mm of mercury) is one that is 
easily maintained permanently in a closed-off system. The 
radiometer has been used successfully in the micropho- 
tometer. The application of the radiometer to the micro- 
photometer places but little demand on flexibility. 

When maximum sensitivity is desired for very delicate 
measurements, the problem arises of choosing which type of 
radiometric instrument will be most sensitive, and further, 
which design of a given type will be most sensitive. 

There are conflicting reports on the ultimate sensitivities 
obtainable with the different types of radiometric instru- 
ments. The thermopile is certainly almost as sensitive as 
any other radiometric instrument, and although other in- 
struments might be made slightly more sensitive than 
vacuum thermopiles, they are usually more difficult to con- 
struct and use. 5 Accordingly, in our treatment here, the 
construction details of radiometric instruments other than 
the thermopile will be omitted. Vacuum thermopiles are 
widely used by experimenters in infrared spectroscopy, 
possibly more often than all other types of radiometric 
instruments taken together. 

Construction and evacuation of a sensitive thermopile. 
The construction of a vacuum thermopile of the type shown 
in Fig. 1 will be described here. 6 This thermopile has two

sition. The thermopile is made compensating by connect- 
ing the junctions in opposition. The receivers are rectangu- 
lar and are placed end to end — an arrangement especially 
suited to spectroscopic investigations. For special prob- 
lems the shape of the receivers as well as other features of the 
design can, of course, be altered. 

A crystalline quartz window is attached with Apiezon 
wax "W." This wax is also used to seal the other joints. 
Apiezon wax "W" is easy to apply and has an extremely low 

vapor pressure — a valuable

permanent high vacuum. 

A porcelain rod of T 3 ¥ inch 
in diameter containing four 
holes holds the relatively 
heavy copper wires on 
which the thermo junctions 
are mounted. The project- 
ing copper wires are fast- 
ened together by mica as 
shown in Fig. 1 or by Alun- 
dum cement as shown in 
Fig. 2 so that they will not vibrate. Four flexible and insu- 
lated copper leads are soldered to these heavier copper wires, 
as shown in Fig. 1, and these are brought outside the housing 
through one of the wax seals. 

Fig. 3 shows one method for maintaining a high vacuum 
of better than 10~ 4 mm of mercury in a thermopile. The 
Pyrex tube shown here is filled with activated charcoal. 
The charcoal tube is evacuated and baked for several hours 
to outgas it before the stopcock is closed to isolate the sys- 
tem from the pumps. At first the vacuum will be main- 
tained at better than 10 -4 mm of mercury for only a few 
hours. However, each time the thermopile is re-evacuated 
the vacuum lasts longer, so that after about five evacuations, 
if the system is tight, the vacuum will remain good for a 
month or so. The vacuum is tested by measuring the sensi-

tivity of the thermopile under some convenient standard 
condition, such as that of exposing the thermopile to a 
60-watt lamp placed 10 inches away and measuring the 
response of the junction with a relatively insensitive galva- 
nometer. The degree of vacuum obtaining in a thermopile 
should not be tested with a spark, since electrostatic forces 
may destroy the junctions.

Wires for the thermojunctions. One thermoelectric wire 
is made of pure bismuth, and the other is an alloy of bismuth 
and 5 per cent tin. The selection of this combination of 
wires to form thermojunctions has been made after a con- 
sideration of the Wiedemann-Franz coefficients, as well as 
of the thermoelectric powers of various possible combinations, 
including such metals as tellurium and the other bismuth 
alloys. 7 

The resistance of each thermoelectric wire should be at 
least 10 ohms, and the wire should not be longer than 3 mm. 
A bismuth wire 3 mm long with a resistance of 10 ohms has

a diameter of about 24fi. The bismuth-tin alloy wire should 
have about 20 per cent more electrical resistance than the 
pure bismuth wire, because of the influence of the Wiede- 
mann-Franz coefficient. However, owing to the greater 

specific electrical resistance 
of the bismuth alloy wire, its 
diameter will be about 7/j, 
greater than the diameter of 
the pure bismuth wire. 

Preparation of the alloy 
wires. Thermoelectric wires 
can be purchased from the 
Baker Company, Newark, 
New Jersey, or they may be 
prepared by the Taylor proc- 
ess. To make the wires by 
the Taylor process, the ther- 
moelectric metal is melted 
and sucked up into a thin- 
wall capillary tube of soft glass. (See Fig. 4.) This tube, 
containing the metal as a core, is heated in a small electric 
furnace and drawn out in the manner shown in Fig. 5. The

diameter of the wires produced in the composite drawn fibers 
is controlled by the temperature of the furnace and the 
speed of drawing. When the temperature of the furnace is

properly regulated, the wires obtained are single crystals 
which can be bent and straightened repeatedly without 
breaking. Wires which are brittle should be discarded. 

The glass is removed from the composite fibers with hydro- 
fluoric acid, which dissolves the soft glass readily but scarcely 
corrodes or etches the metal. The hydrofluoric acid, usually 
diluted with a little water to suppress fuming, is conveniently 
held either in a shallow dish which has been coated with 
paraffin or simply in a groove melted in a block of paraffin. 
The wires are withdrawn from the acid with metal forceps 
and washed in a weak solution of Aerosol. 8 (Avoid letting 
the acid come in contact with the fingers.) The wires must 
be freed from all glass or difficulty in cutting and solder- 
ing will be encountered. About 5 minutes in the acid is re- 
quired. 

The good wires are mounted in flat cigar boxes, one for 
each of the metals. The electrical resistance of each wire 
should be measured and its resistance per unit length noted 
on a small label attached opposite the wire. After an assort- 
ment of wire sizes has been collected and measured, one is 
prepared to proceed with the construction of junctions of 
prescribed characteristics. 

Construction of the junctions. A microscope of about 10- 
power magnification facilitates the manipulation and solder- 
ing of the thermoelectric wires. An erecting binocular 
type giving stereoscopic vision is ideal. 

Fig. 6 illustrates the manner of soldering the thermo- 
electric wires to the copper supporting wires with a hot 
tinned sewing needle. The hot-wire device used for heating 
the needle is electrically heated, the heat being regulated by 
a resistance. The temperature of the tip of the sewing needle 

8 Aerosol or the detergent Dreft, the latter of which is sold in grocery stores, 
has many uses around the laboratory. Besides its usefulness in washing glass, 
aluminum mirrors, and so forth, it can be added to water to decrease its surface 
tension and increase wetting power. This is advisable for washing thermo- 
couple wires, as the solution wets the wires and dissolves the hydrofluoric acid. 
Also, for coating the receivers, the solution with added Dreft has less "attrac- 
tion" due to surface tension, and accordingly there is less danger of destroying 
the work when the brush with its blackening material is applied.

can be further controlled by varying the point of contact 
between the hot wire and the tip of the needle. 

Wood's metal is used for 
soldering. A solution of pure 
zinc chloride in distilled 
water is used as flux. After 
the soldering is completed, 
the excess zinc chloride 
should be carefully removed 
with a small brush wet with 
distilled water. 

When the thermoelectric 
wires, which are selected for 
size so that each will be 
about 3 mm long, are soldered 
to the tinned copper supports, they are then "cut" to the 
proper length by touching them with the hot tinned needle 
as shown in Fig. 7. This not only "cuts" the wires but 
tins their ends at the same time. Difficulty with this 
operation will be encountered unless all of the glass has been 
dissolved off the wires. 

These thermoelectric wires 
are now manipulated with a 
cold needle so that their ends 
are in contact. A little flux is 
added to their junction, and 
the soldering is effected by 
heat radiated from the hot- 
wire device. (See Fig. 8.) 
The junction is to be care- 
fully watched. The instant 
to withdraw the heat is indi- 
cated by a slight jerk of the 
tips of the wires due to surface tension of the fused metal. If 
the resistance is too great, each wire is shortened by heating 
the Wood's metal at the base of the wire. Molten Wood's 
metal pulls in the thermocouple wire by surface tension.

The needle is used to heat the Wood's metal. In this way,

wires used have been taken from the same stock piece of 
bismuth or alloy wire, the sensitivities of the junction will 
match closely. 

Ruggedness in the final thermopile is obtained by the use 
of fine quartz fibers to support the thermoelectric wires and 
attached receivers. The quartz fibers are fastened to the 
copper supporting wires by thin lacquer as illustrated in 
Fig. 9.

is a convenient size for spectroscopy) on the stage of the 
10X microscope by means of a razor blade as shown in 
Fig. 10. The receivers are strengthened mechanically by 
giving them a cylindrical curvature in the following manner : 
The receiver is placed on a sheet of thin fine-grade paper 
mounted on blotting paper, and a rod of about 0.5 mm in 
diameter is pressed against it. (See Fig. 10.) Gold is 
particularly suitable for receivers because it is easily 
soldered. 

A tiny bit of Wood's metal fused to the junction by radia- 
tion and wetted with flux facilitates attaching the receiver.

The gold receiver is laid in contact with the thermo junction 
and soldered by heating it with radiation from the hot-wire 
device. (See Fig. 11.) A slight jerk of the receiver indi- 
cates when the heater should be withdrawn. 

After the receivers are soldered in place, they are blackened 
with lampblack or other blackening material with the aid of 
a very small amount of glue as a binder. This mixture is 
applied to the receiver with a small camel's-hair brush as 
shown in Fig. 12. 

9 Gold leaf of the required thickness is prepared by evaporating a proper 
amount of gold in vacuum (see Chapter IV) from a tungsten coil onto a glass 
plate. The film is then washed off the glass with a stream of water.

Finally, two quartz fibers are fastened over each receiver 
for added ruggedness. The fibers are so fine and at the same 
time such poor heat conductors that the ruggedness gained 
by their use more than compensates for the negligible heat 
leakage which they introduce. Fig. 13 illustrates the method 
of securing the receivers and shows the completed thermopile.

The selection of the proper window material for the 
thermopile is governed by the spectral region in which it is 
to be used. The appropriate 
choice can be made from the 
data given in Table I. 

High-melting-point paraffin 
for use in the far infrared, 
listed in Table I, should not be 
confused with ordinary low- 
melting-point paraffin. High- 
melting-point paraffin is a 
crystalline material that does 
not deform when it is subjected 
to small stresses. In order to 
obtain strength and at the 
same time have the paraffin win- 
dow very thin, it is advisable 
to make the window cylindrical, 
of using a tube of paraffin turned out in the lathe. It is 
sufficient to have the cylindrical paraffin window only 1 mm 
thick. Inasmuch as the thermopile cannot be seen through 

the paraffin window, it is neces- 
sary to adjust the receivers to 
the focal point of the radia- 
tions with the help of the gal- 
vanometer. 

Although the Taylor process 
for preparing thermoelectric 
wires is recommended, it is pos- 
sible to obtain wires by the 
process used by Professor A. H. 
Pfund, whereby the molten 
metal is spashed on a plate of 
glass. One may either select 
small wires, that are accident- 
ally formed, or cut wires with a razor blade from the thin 
foil that is also formed. Wires obtained by this method have

the disadvantage that, owing to fluctuations in their size, it 
is difficult to make matched junctions with them. 

An alternate method of joining the thermocouple wires 
and attaching the receivers involves welding the thermo- 
electric wires together by means of a condenser discharge. 
The details of this procedure are given in the paper cited 
below. 10 

The receiver may be waxed to the welded thermojunction 
with Apiezon wax "W." This method of attaching the re- 
ceiver yields almost the same sensitivity as soldering. 

It is easier to construct a multiple- junction thermopile 
if one large receiver is waxed to the junctions than to under- 
take the delicate task of soldering separate small receivers 

to each junction. The elec-

trical insulation between the 
junctions of a multiple- junc- 
tion thermopile can be ef- 
fected by coating each junc- 
tion with lacquer before 
applying the wax used for 
holding the receivers. 

Some experimenters con- 
struct thermocouples in an 
order almost opposite to 
that described. The junc- 
tion is formed, the receiver 
is fastened to the junction, 
and, finally, the thermo- 
couple is soldered to the 
supporting wires. 11 This 
procedure is especially suited to the construction of a ther- 
mocouple with a small circular receiver, such as may be 
required for stellar radiometry. For a stellar thermocouple 
the junction may be soldered with a larger bit of Wood's 
metal so that there is formed at the junction a small sphere

of metal, which is then compressed to form a flat receiver of 
circular shape and of the desired diameter. 

Professor Pfund constructs thermocouples by compressing 
the thermoelectric wires together on a plate of polished steel 
that is heated to about 100°C. 12 The receiver can be joined 
to the junction in the same manner. A special device made 
from a knife switch is used for the manipulation as shown in 
Fig. 17. 

For most applications lampblack is suitable for coating the 
receiver, but in special cases it may be preferable to use a 
selective absorbing material for "blackening" the receiver. 13 
Thus, a thermopile used for investigation in the far infra- 
red spectrum between 52/j, and 152/j, might have receivers 
"blackened" with powdered glass. For work in the visible 
and ultraviolet spectrum an electrolytic deposit of platinum 
black is particularly suitable. 

The loss of heat by the radiation from a receiver is deter- 
mined primarily by the emission of the receiver in the spec- 
tral region around 10yu (the region in which the maximum 
emission from a black body at room temperature occurs). 
The emissive power of platinum black in the region around 
IOjU is weak (about 20 per cent of that of a black body). 
Thus, the use of platinum black has the effect of reducing the 
heat loss L\, so that the receiver is effectively only one fifth 
as great as if the receiver were coated with a material that is 
black for the heat spectrum as well as for the visible spec- 
trum. Besides increasing the sensitivity, this has the further

involves the use of calcium as a getter. This method has 
been used by Dr. Pettit of the Mount Wilson Observatory 
and is quite satisfactory. Its use amounts to replacing the 
active charcoal in the thermopile in Fig. 3 with fresh calcium 
filings. These calcium filings are baked out while the tube 
is connected to the pump. Later, from time to time when 
the sensitivity of the thermopile falls off, owing to a decay 
of the vacuum, maximum sensitivity can be re-established 
simply by reheating the calcium. 

The use of sensitive thermopiles. As ordinarily used, the 
radiant energy focused on the active receiving surface of the 
thermopile is interrupted periodically to isolate the effect 
of this radiation from the effect of other radiations falling on 
the receiver. The excursion of the galvanometer resulting 
from interrupting the measured beam is ascribed to changes 
in the temperature of the junctions produced by the radiant 
energy. Considering that delicate measurements may pro- 
duce a change in temperature of only 10 -6 °C, it is necessary 
to interrupt the light rather accurately to compensate for 
the first-order drifts which arise owing to a constant warm- 
ing or cooling of the surroundings of the entire thermopile. 
As a result, just as much time is required for controlling the 
zero position of the galvanometer as for determining the 
deflection produced by the energy being measured. 

It is evident that care is required in selecting the best 
position for the shutter in an optical system. For example, 
it is required that the change in the radiant energy falling on 
the thermopile due to closing the shutter should be the same 
as the change produced by removing the source of the radia- 
tions without changing the position of any object "seen" 
by the thermopile. Otherwise, the variation of radiation 
from closing the shutter may falsify the measurement. The 
shutter is to be put before the entrance slit of the spec- 
trometer rather than after the exit slit in order to mini- 
mize this possibility. 

Compensated thermopiles. While first-order drifts in 
the galvanometer can be eliminated even for an uncom- 



Chap. VIII] VACUUM THERMOPILES 323 

pensated thermopile by properly timing the exposures of the 
thermopile to the radiant energy, second-order drifts (due 
to a change in rate of the drift) can be eliminated only by 
the use of a compensated thermopile. In practice, it is 
difficult to construct a compensating receiver that will effect 
the elimination of more than 90 per cent of the galvanometer 
drift, but further compensation can be achieved by shunting 
an electrical resistance across the most sensitive of the 
junctions, either the active or the compensating ones. The 
junctions to be shunted and the value of the shunt resistance 
are determined experimentally. When the shunt resistance 
has the proper value, severe temperature changes of the 
surroundings of the thermopile housing produce a minimum 
deflection of the galvanometer. If care has been taken in 
constructing a compensated thermopile, the shunting re- 
sistance will be great enough so that the sensitivity of the 
thermopile is not appreciably impaired. One method of 
testing the compensation is to hold a hot soldering iron a few 
centimeters in front of the thermopile. When, for example, 
a particular thermopile of the type shown in Fig. 1 was 
compensated, the galvanometer drift was diminished to a 
twentieth part of the original drift, and it was reduced 
further a hundredfold by the shunting resistance. 

Ordinarily, the energy to be measured is concentrated on 
one receiver; the compensating receiver then acts as an ex- 
ternal resistance in the galvanometer circuit, and therefore 
the deflections are somewhat diminished. In most cases the 
reduction of first- and second-order drifts justifies compen- 
sation and the attendant smaller deflections. 

By another procedure the image of the exit slit of the 
spectrometer covers both receivers, while a shutter in front 
of the entrance slit of the spectrometer obscures first the 
aperture of the half of the slit focused on one receiver and 
then the half focused on the other receiver. 14 Thus the 
area of each of the two receivers is half the area of the slit. 
Theoretically, this scheme is expected to yield about 40 

14 Badger, R. M., J.O.S.A., 15, 370 (1927). 



324 VACUUM THERMOPILES [Chap. VIII 

per cent more sensitivity than the ordinary compensated 
thermopile which has the area of the active receiver, as well 
as that of the compensating one, each equal to the area of the 
slit. In order to realize this 40 per cent gain in another 
but less desirable way, the mirror used for concentrating the 
radiant energy may be tilted periodically, so that the image 
of the exit slit of the spectrometer covers first one receiver 
and then the other. 

Auxiliary apparatus. Ordinarily a galvanometer having a 
period of about 7 seconds and a low resistance of about 10 to 
15 ohms is used with a thermopile. For making delicate 
measurements, the wires leading from the thermopile to the 
galvanometer should be shielded, so that alternating cur- 
rents will not be induced in them by stray electromagnetic 
fields. When the wires are not properly shielded, induced 
alternating currents are, in a sense, rectified by the thermo- 
pile, especially by an uncompensated thermopile, and give a 
spurious galvanometer deflection. 

A simple method of measuring the galvanometer response 
is to observe a well-illuminated scale with a telescope. The 
galvanometer should be arranged so that the scale is at a 
distance of about 5 m. A telescope of about 32-power 
magnification, placed as close as possible to the galva- 
nometer, should be used. With a galvanometer mirror 10 mm 
in diameter, it should be possible to see the millimeter 
divisions so clearly on a scale at a distance of 5 m that de- 
flections on the scale can be estimated to a small fraction 
of a millimeter. 

A lack of definition is often erroneously attributed to the 
galvanometer mirror, but it is usually due to the use of 
optically imperfect glass for the galvanometer window. 
However, there is a limit to the definition attainable, because 
of the finite size of the galvanometer mirror and the effect of 
diffraction. A simple rule is that the scale distance as 
measured in meters must not be greater than the diameter of 
the galvanometer mirror as measured in millimeters. Thus, 
for a scale distance of 5 m, the galvanometer should be at

least 5 mm in diameter. About ^ mm deflection at a dis- 
tance of 5 m corresponds to the unavoidable natural fluctua- 
tions in the position of the galvanometer due to Brownian 
motion.

might at first be supposed. A standard laboratory experi- 
ment for students at the University of Berlin is to estimate 
the positions of extra marks made on a millimeter scale. 
All of the extra marks are made on a ruling engine, so that 
their positions are accurately known. Although the lines 
are all about T V mm wide, the student is asked to estimate 
the position of each extra line to t^tt nun. In estimating 
these positions, a student seldom makes an error of -ru mm, 



326 VACUUM THERMOPILES [Chap. VIII 

and an experienced observer will have a probable error for a 
single reading of about 0.03 mm. Accordingly, it is signifi- 
cant to estimate galvanometer readings to ^V Toam. 

Fig. 18 shows an ingenious and accurate arrangement 
used by Professor Czerny for determining the magnitude of 
small galvanometer deflections. 15 

Relays. A convenient method of reading galvanometer 
deflections is to use an optical amplifier. Also, when it is 
desirable to record radiometric measurements photographi- 
cally, the primary deflections should be amplified by means 
of some type of relay, and the deflections of a secondary 
galvanometer recorded on moving photographic paper. 

The Moll and Burger thermo-relay may be used for am- 
plifying galvanometer deflections until Brownian motion 
becomes conspicuous. 16 Other amplifiers include the barrier- 
layer photocell amplifier described by Barnes and Matossi 17 
and the thermopile with two triangular-shaped receivers 
described by Cartwright. 18 

The Barnes and Matossi type of relay is made by dividing 
the active surface of a barrier-layer photocell by scratching 
along a diameter so as to make two contiguous semicircular 
areas of active surface. The arrangement of this amplifier 
is illustrated in Fig. 17, Chapter X. Leeds and Northrup 
produce an amplifying galvanometer and photocell combina- 
tion of this type. 19 

The above methods of amplifying galvanometer deflec- 
tions also magnify the drift of the primary galvanometer. 
This is undesirable. Pfund and Hardy have devised a 
resonance radiometer, which tends to "ignore" drift and 
separate it from the response to the measured radiation. 20

Their scheme is somewhat elaborate and requires the use of 
a tuned pendulum shutter, in addition to two identical gal- 
vanometers. However, the instrument has advantages, es- 
pecially when the thermopile is not adequately protected 
from extraneous thermal effects. Pfund describes the 
resonance radiometer briefly as follows: 

If primary and secondary galvanometers are underdamped and 
adjusted to the same period, then, by interrupting the radiation 
falling on the thermopile with a periodicity corresponding to that 
of the galvanometers, a condition of resonance is set up. As a 
class, resonating systems are characterized by high sensitivity 
for "tuned" periodic disturbances and by indifference to random 
disturbances. 

This indifference to random disturbances unfortunately 
does not include Brownian motions of the primary galva- 
nometer. Hardy has measured the effect of the Brownian 
motion on the resonance radiometer and has found that the 
fluctuations in the deflection of the secondary galvanometer 
are magnified in accord with theoretical predictions for fluctu- 
ations due to Brownian motion. 21 Nevertheless, Hardy feels 
that delicate measurement to the limit set by these effects is 
definitely facilitated by the use of the resonance radiometer. 
The slowness of the resonance radiometer (it takes about 90 
seconds to make a measurement) is one of its disadvantages. 

Firestone 22 has made an ingenious variation from the 
Pfund scheme. It depends on charging and discharging a 
condenser through the secondary galvanometer with a 
circuit controlled by the amplified thermocouple current. 
A photocell amplifier is used. Naturally, as the output 
galvanometer circuit has infinite ohmic resistance, owing to 
the condenser in the circuit, no net current can flow, and 
consequently all deflections are excursions about an unchang- 
ing zero position. 

We have emphasized the importance of using a com- 
pensated thermopile to diminish galvanometer drifts as well

Construction of thermojunctions by evaporation and 
sputtering. There are other applications of thermopiles and 
thermocouples, such as their use for vacuum manometers, 
for measuring alternating currents, for measuring sound 
intensities, for magnifying deflections of a spot of light in 
thermo-relays, and for total-radiation pyrometers. We 
cannot go into all these applications in detail, but the 
present chapter and the references cited should serve to 
guide an experimenter in these fields. The construction 
of thermopiles by evaporation and sputtering, however, 
warrants a description. 

Thermopiles made from films of the thermoelectrically 
active metals, produced by evaporation or sputtering, can 
be constructed having a very low heat capacity, so low, in 
fact, that they will respond to the adiabatic heating produced 
by separate sound waves of 5000 cycles frequency. 23 

One of the metal films used is bismuth and the other is 
antimony. The foundation on which the metal films are 
deposited must be extremely thin and strong. For this 
purpose, glass, mica, or lacquer films are used. 

When a soft-glass tube is fused at one end and strongly 
blown out with air pressure so as to expand and explode a 
thin bulb, the shattered bulb wall yields fine ribbons of glass 
about 1 or 2 mm wide and 1 or 2 cm long. These ribbons 
are of such a thickness as to give interference colors and make 
a suitable foundation for evaporated thermocouples. 

When a mica sheet is rolled upon a stick of about 2 mm 
in diameter so that one of the principal directions is parallel 
to the stick, it is subject to shearing forces. These forces 
produce cleavages, so that when the sheet is subsequently 
split, bands from 1 to 0.1 mm wide are obtained which, 
judging from their interference colors, are as thin as or 
thinner than lfx. 2i

purposes, may be made by dropping a thinned solution of 
lacquer onto the surface of a bowl of dust-free distilled 
water. 25 Surface tension causes the drop to spread out, 
forming a liquid film on the water over about half the area 
of the water surface. The lacquer soon becomes solid as the 
solvent evaporates. Fig. 20 shows how these films are 
taken off the water on a metal frame. They are allowed to 
dry after the peripheral area of the film is pulled back any- 
where that it is in contact with the main stretched area. 
The thickness of film desired is controlled by varying the 
dilution of the lacquer before it is dropped on the water.

Fig. 20. 

Extremely thin uniform films are formed on water cooled to 
0°C. Films as thin as 5 X 10 -6 cm are obtainable. Double 
films formed on a frame as illustrated in Fig. 20 are stronger 
than single films of double thickness, owing to the fact that, 
in the case of double films, weak areas in one film are seldom 
opposite weak areas in the second film. 

When the thermoelectric metal is deposited on the founda- 
tion film by evaporation, the heat of condensation of the 
metal vapor, as well as the heat radiated by the filament 
and absorbed by the film, tends to elevate the temperature 
of the foundation. It is necessary to prevent the tempera- 
ture of the film from rising to a point at which it might be

destructive: The films are mounted in the evaporation 
chamber in contact with mercury or, better yet, in contact 
with a copper cooling block. 

Following the procedure described by Burger and van 
Cittert 26 bismuth and antimony are used for the thermo- 
junctions, the bismuth being evaporated to form a strip 
about lju thick, while the antimony is evaporated to form a 
strip of half this thickness. The proper weight of metal to 
be evaporated is determined by a simple calculation using 
Eq. 2 in Chapter IV. The area coated with the metal is 
defined by templates. The bismuth strip, which is evap- 
orated first, is deposited a little beyond the point which is 
to be the center of the junction, say 0.2 mm or so. Then, 
the evaporated antimony strip is allowed to overlap the 
center by an equal amount. The area where the strips over- 
lap forms the junction. The junction is then coated by 
evaporation with bismuth black, antimony black, or zinc 
black over a prescribed area, which is defined by baffles. 

To form an area to which electrical contact may be es- 
tablished, gold is sputtered or evaporated at appropriate 
points on the metal films. The connector wires may then 
be soldered to the gold. 

The bismuth crystals formed in the strip by condensation 
of vapors have their axes perpendicular to the base. This 
crystal orientation results in a thermoelectromotive force 
against antimony of 75 microvolts/°C. The optimum crys- 
tal orientation, so far unattainable by evaporation, gives a 
thermoelectromotive force of about twice this value. 

Evaporated thermo junctions are especially useful for 
making the Moll and Burger type thermo-relay. Burger 
and van Cittert were able to obtain a sensitivity about two 
and one-half times as great as that obtained with the 
ordinary rolled Moll and Burger element. 

Considerations in thermopile design. The thermopile 
shown in Fig. 1 and described above can be adapted to meet 
most of the needs of an experimenter interested in making 

26 Burger, H. C, and van Cittert, P. H., Zeits. f. Physik, 66, 210 (1930). 



332 VACUUM THERMOPILES [Chap. VIII 

radiometric measurements. Some experimenters, espe- 
cially those intending to make extremely delicate measure- 
ments, will be interested in the theory for the design of 
thermopiles. For example, the experimenter designing a 
vacuum thermopile of a given area has several decisions to 
make. He must decide which metals to select for the 
thermocouple wires and determine whether to make few or 
many junctions. Also, he must decide on the material to 
be used for coating the receivers. Or, he may wish to de- 
sign a thermopile to operate at atmospheric pressure. 

The equations expressing the theoretical dependence of the 
galvanometer response on the number of junctions, area of 
receiver, characteristics of thermoelectric wires, and so forth, 
have been completely developed. 27 Calculations based on 
this theory require a knowledge of the characteristics of the 
thermoelectric wires, namely, their thermoelectric power, 
electrical conductivity, and heat conductivity. The calcu- 
lations also require a knowledge of the optical properties of 
receiving surfaces, such as their emissivity and reflectivity 
for various wave lengths. With this information, it is 
possible to design the thermopile which will give optimum 
response under the obtaining conditions. 

The characteristic sensitivity of a thermopile determines 
its response and, in the theory, this quantity Q is defined as 
follows : 

Q = vm. (2) 

<i> is the radiant energy falling on the receivers in unit time, 
/ is the current in the galvanometer-thermopile circuit, and 
R is the total resistance in this circuit. Q is in effect like 
an efficiency — the efficiency with which the radiant energy 
to be measured is converted into galvanometer deflections. 
The expression for Q for an uncompensated vacuum ther- 
mopile of n junctions in terms of the quantities on which it 
depends is

The quantity in the brackets represents the total heat 
losses of the receiver. The middle term in the brackets 
represents heat loss by conduction through the wires, and the 
third term represents heat loss due to the Peltier effect. 
Ordinarily the influence of Peltier heat on the design may be 
neglected. 

The first term in the brackets represents the heat lost by 
radiation and gas conduction. Where the receiver is not in 
a high vacuum, gas conduction has the same effect on ther- 
mopile design as increasing the magnitude of e and, as we 
have pointed out before, the use of a receiver with a small 
emissivity for heat radiation, e, has the effect on thermopile 
design of decreasing the quantity cA. 

Fig. 21 illustrates for a vacuum thermopile the way in 
which Q depends on the values of eA, the number of junc- 
tions, and the total electrical resistance in the thermopile 
circuit. With e taken as unity the curves are constructed 
for A = 1 mm 2 and A = 3 mm 2 . Furthermore, these 
curves are for thermoelectric wires made of pure bismuth

It is desirable, from a practical point of view, to have a 
minimum number of junctions to build. The information 
given in Fig. 21 facilitates making the compromise between

this practical consideration, on the one hand, and the desire 
to have a maximum sensitivity on the other. From curves 
in this figure, it is apparent that the energy should be con- 
centrated onto a receiver which is as small as possible. 

By reference to Eq. 3 we see that when the third term in 
the brackets is small in comparison with the first and second 
terms, the sensitivity, Q, appears to be proportional to the 
thermoelectric power, P. This is not always the case in 
practice, and a thermoelectric metal should not be chosen 
on the basis of the thermoelectric power alone. As a matter 
of fact, most metals with a high thermoelectric power have an 
unfavorable Wiedemann-Franz coefficient, which may, in the 
end, make them even less desirable than metals such as the 
bismuth alloys, which are convenient to manage. 28 

Sensitivity and minimum energy detectable. When the 
quantity Q, given by Eq. 2, is combined with the current 
sensitivity, dd/dl, and the total resistance of the circuit, B, 
it yields the composite sensitivity, S, of a thermopile and 
critically damped galvanometer according to the formula

It has been customary to compare the sensitivities, S, of 
the various radiometric instruments. This has led to some 
confusion in the literature. Actually, in making the most 
delicate radiometric measurements, we are not interested 
primarily in the value of S (which can be made as large as 
desired by the use of an amplifier) but rather in the accuracy 
with which the radiant energy can be measured in a given

where p is the specific electrical resistivity and T the absolute temperature.

time, or, what amounts to the same thing, in the smallest 
intensity of radiant energy that can be measured in a given 
time with a given accuracy. The magnitude of this smallest 
deflection is influenced by disturbances acting on the in- 
struments. 

We will designate this smallest deflection that can be 
measured by a single reading in a time t , and with a mean 
relative error g, by the symbol mto . Until 1926 it was 
considered that the elimination of the disturbances on which 
the value of mln . depends was simply a matter of refining 
experimental technique. Ising was the first to point out 
that our experimental technique is already advanced far 
enough so that in many cases mln . is determined by the 
ever-present Brownian motion fluctuations. 29 If we 
consider the thermopile system isolated from all disturb- 
ances except those produced by Brownian motion of the 
galvanometer, then the value of mIn . is easy to determine. 
According to the principle of the equipartition of energy, 
every object with one degree of freedom, such as the moving 
system of our galvanometer, will possess a definite amount of 
kinetic and potential energy. The average value of the 
kinetic energy or potential energy at 19°C. is 

ikT = 2 X 10~ 21 watt sec. (5) 

The average deflection due to the potential energy is in- 
volved in the expression 

Potential energy = \K& = \¥F, (6) 

where K is the torsional constant of the suspension and k is 
Boltzmann's constant. When a reading is taken, the 
fluctuations of 9 give rise to an uncertainty amounting to 
■VkT '/ K. Therefore, in order to have a probable error of g, 
a single deflection must be at least 1/g times the average 
fluctuation, or

It can be shown that this expression is a general one appli-

ments, it is necessary to specify not only the accuracy factor

In the case of a galvanometer, this is because the value of 
dd/dl depends on t . The value of S also depends on f for 
other radiometric instruments. It is not correct to assume, as 
is usually done, that the value of $ m)n . varies with the square 
of the period of the deflecting device. As a matter of fact, 
in the case of a thermopile and critically damped galva- 
nometer, the value of $ mln . is proportional to the square root 
of the period time of the galvanometer. 30 

The $ mln . of a thermopile and galvanometer can be 
expressed in terms of the factor g, the Q of the thermopile, 
and the period of the galvanometer, as follows: 

1.1 X io- 10 
* min - = gQVto watt (9) 

With the values of Q given by the curves in Fig. 12 it is 
therefore possible to estimate the minimum energy falling on 
the receiver in unit time that can be measured with a pro- 
posed apparatus. It is to be observed that the sensitivity of 
the galvanometer does not enter Eq. 9. Eq. 9, however, 
does imply that the deflections are measured either directly 
or with the help of an amplifying device to the limit set by 
Brownian motion. 

General summary of the work on thermopile design. The 
remainder of this chapter will be devoted to a summary of 
the results of experimental and theoretical investigations 
made by one of the authors, C. Hawley Cartwright, on the

relative merits of the different radiometric instruments, and 
in addition will present some general (although not neces- 
sarily final) conclusions resulting from these studies. 

Vacuum microradiometers can be made which will measure 
less energy, <& mln ., than the best vacuum thermopiles used 
with a separate galvanometer. This advantage is not 
sufficient to offset the practical advantage of greater flexi- 
bility of the thermopile with separate galvanometer. 

Vacuum bolometers and vacuum thermopiles have at 
present practically the same limit, $ min . If a material 
with better characteristics than nickel were available for the 
construction of the bolometer strip, this situation would 
be altered. 

Radiometers will not respond to as small energies, $ mln ., 
as thermopiles. The direct comparisons made by the 
author, especially in Berlin and Brussels, between vacuum 
thermopiles and radiometers yield results in favor of vacuum 
thermopiles. Radiometers are usually much more sensitive 
than thermopile and galvanometer combinations, owing to 
the use of a much lighter moving system than is possible 
with a galvanometer. Brownian motions are, however, 
increased, so that they more than offset the advantage of 
the larger primary deflections. 

A question of considerable importance and one which bears 
on the above conclusions is the following: Why is there 
often considerable variation in the sensitivity of vacuum 
thermopiles, in fact, sufficiently large variations to be re- 
sponsible for many of the publications that have appeared 
on improving thermopiles? The answer is that many 
vacuum thermopiles are not constructed with the maximum 
possible sensitivity, for the following reasons : 

1. The sensitivity of a thermopile depends on the skill 
exercised in its construction. 

2. For the most part, thermopiles have been constructed 
without first calculating the proper design or, if this is done, 
without dependable information on the physical properties 
of the materials used. 



Chap. VIII] VACUUM THERMOPILES 339 

3. A sufficiently high vacuum is not always used. A 
properly designed and constructed thermopile should be 
about twenty times more sensitive in high vacuum than in 
air, and, on increasing the vacuum from 10~ 3 to 10 -6 mm of 
mercury, the sensitivity should be doubled. 

4. The thermoelectric power of the bismuth and bismuth- 
alloy wires is often less than 120 microvolts/°C. Slight 
impurities can greatly influence the thermoelectric power of 
bismuth by influence on crystal orientation, and so forth. 
For example, the thermoelectric power of pure bismuth 
relative to copper changes from 57 to 107.7 microvolts/°C. 
for different crystal orientations. 31 

5. The influence of deviations of the properties of bismuth, 
and especially bismuth alloys, from the predictions of the 
Wiedemann-Franz law is generally neglected, with the result 
that thermoelectric wires with a resistance which is too small 
are used so that the sensitivity falls on the left-hand steep 
part of the curves corresponding to those shown in Fig. 21. 

Actually, the ultimate attainable sensitivity for a thermo- 
pile is limited by the unfavorable departure from the Wiede- 
mann-Franz law of the thermoelectric metals that possess a 
high thermoelectric power. However, if this were not the 
case, it is interesting to note that the thermoelectric power 
itself would limit the sensitivity. From Eq. 3 we see that 
for a thermoelectric power of 250 microvolts/°C. the heat 
loss due to the Peltier effect is equal to the heat loss due to 
conduction through the wires. Although the possibility 
exists of finding better thermoelectric metals than bismuth 
and the alloy of bismuth and 5 per cent tin, it seems rather 
improbable that much progress will be made in this direction. 

It is well to keep in mind that although tin has ten times 
less specific electrical resistance than bismuth, an alloy of 
bismuth and 5 per cent tin has twice the specific electrical 
resistance of pure bismuth. This should be considered when 
better thermoelectric metals are being sought. Bismuth

itself is an unusually favorable metal for thermopiles, not 
only because it has a relatively high thermoelectric power, 
but also because it is a pure metal element having a small 
specific electrical resistance and does not depart greatly 
from the Wiedemann-Franz law. 

In order to improve the sensitivity of thermopiles, there 
is the possibility of using them at low temperatures, where 
Q can be increased, owing to a greater thermoelectric power, 
a more favorable Wiedemann-Franz ratio, and less radiation 
loss from the receivers. However, liquid-air thermopiles 
have several practical disadvantages. 32

Divisions of the spectrum. The electromagnetic spectrum 
divides naturally into the region for which the eye is sensitive, 
the infrared region, with frequencies below those which we 
perceive as red, and the ultraviolet region, with frequencies 
higher than those which we perceive as violet. These 
regions are defined roughly by the wave lengths given in 
Table I. In the text we will use microns for expressing wave 
length in the infrared and Angstroms for expressing wave 
length in the visible and ultraviolet. The visible region 
includes less than one octave of frequency, while the so-called 
infrared region embraces at least nine octaves and the ultra- 
violet embraces five or six octaves.
