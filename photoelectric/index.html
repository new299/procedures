CHAPTER X 

Photoelectric Cells and Amplifiers 

BY 

A. E. Whitford 

Introduction 

T^HE photoelectric cell has found an important place in 
-■- the physical laboratory as a device for the measurement 
of the intensity of radiation, and as such may be classed with 
the thermocouple and the photographic plate. In common 
with the photographic plate its response varies with wave 
length, so that it does not measure energy directly, as does 
the thermocouple. The photographic plate, because of its 
ability to integrate extremely long exposures, can be used to 
measure smaller quantities of radiation than can the photo- 
electric cell. But the photographic plate has the definite 
disadvantage that its blackening is a complicated function 
of intensity and exposure time, necessitating a series of 
calibration exposures whose intensity ratios are known. 
Furthermore, plate grain, local variations in emulsion sensi- 
tivity, and nonuniform development place limitations on the 
precision obtainable in photographic photometry. Both 
the photocell and the thermocouple, when used with suitable 
precautions, give a response linear with respect to the inten- 
sity, and both are capable of giving more precise results than 
the photographic plate. In the infrared beyond about 
10,000 A, the thermocouple (or other heat-sensitive devices 
such as the bolometer) must be used. At shorter wave 
lengths, however, it is possible to measure much smaller 
amounts of radiation with the photoelectric cell than with 
the thermocouple.

Limit of detection compared. An attempt to set an 
ultimate limit for any of the above-mentioned detectors of 
radiation must of necessity be approximate, because the 
working limit depends on various factors such as the angular 
size and shape of the source, the spectral distribution of the 
radiation it gives out, and the presence or absence of back- 
ground radiation. Because the stars offer a common basis 
for comparing the response of light-sensitive devices to weak 
sources, they are chosen as reference standards in this dis- 
cussion. The magnitudes of the stars form a logarithmic 
scale such that an intensity ratio of 100 times corresponds to 
5 magnitudes. Thus 1 magnitude represents an intensity 
ratio of -^100, or 2.512. ... In general, the difference in 
magnitude between two stars whose intensities are Ii and 7 2 is 
given by mi — m% = 2.5 logio Ii/I\. A candle at a kilometer 
has been found 1 equivalent to a star of visual magnitude 
+ 0.8, approximately the brightness of Altair. From these re- 
lations one may easily derive an equation giving the amount 
of light received by a telescope from a given star. If m is 
the visual magnitude of the star, d the diameter of the tele- 
scope in inches, and Q the amount of light expressed in 
lumens, 2 then it may be shown that 

2.5 log™ Q = 7.57 -30 + 5 logio d - m. 

As an example, we may compute the amount of light re- 
ceived by a 1-inch telescope from the polestar, 3 which has a 
visual magnitude of 2.1. Substitution in the formula gives 
1.5 X 10~ 10 lumen. Of course, the stars differ among them- 
selves as to the spectral distribution of the light they give 
out. In this comparison, stars of spectral class G having

2 The lumen is the unit of luminous flux. It is equal to the flux emitted in a 
unit solid angle by a uniform point source of 1 international candle. 

3 Polaris, in combination with a small laboratory telescope, provides a 
convenient order-of-magnitude standard source for testing the responses of 
photoelectric cells to weak radiation. It is a variable, with a period of about 
4 days, and an amplitude between maximum and minimum of 0.08 magnitude 
to 0.16 magnitude, depending on the spectral sensitivity of the measuring 
device. Its year-round availability and negligible diurnal motion are reasons 
for its choice over more constant stars.

the same temperature as the sun are selected. As is well 
known, the radiation curve of the sun is roughly that of a 
black body at 6000 °K. The results for four detectors of 
radiation are given in Table I. These represent the limit 
reached in actual practice and not the theoretical limit. In 
the case of the photoelectric cell and thermocouple, for which 
the response is a "pointer reading," the criterion for limit of 
detection is taken as the average deviation of successive 
deflections from the mean when measuring a star near the 
useful limit of the instrument.

The data given in Table I are for response to a point source 
emitting "white" light, that is, light having the spectral 
quality of sunlight. For cases in which the image of the 
source cannot be made very small, the thermocouple must 
have larger receivers, and the limit is not as small as that 
given in the table by a factor of 5 to 10. The photographic 
plate also suffers when the source is an extended luminous

area, because the light is spread over a greater area on the 
emulsion. According to Biltz, 4 at 4360 A it requires an 
energy of the order of 10 -2 erg/cm 2 at the emulsion surface 
to give a perceptible blackening. The response of the photo- 
electric cell is independent of image size and shape as long as 
the image is not larger than the cathode. This gives it 
considerable advantage over the photographic plate in rapid 
measurement of low surface brightness. 

The thermocouple, of course, measures energy independent 
of the spectral distribution of the light. The response curve 
of the human eye is given in Fig. 4, page 410. At the wave 
length of maximum visibility, 1 lumen = 1.61 X 10~ 3 watt. 
The variation of the sensitivity of various photographic 
plates with wave length is given by Mees. 6 The spectral 
response curves of various types of photoelectric cells are 
given on page 401. Assuming that the limit of detection is 
set by the smallest current that can be measured, these curves 
may be considered to give the limit of detection as a function 
of wave length. The case cited in Table I in which 4 X 10~ 9 
erg/sec. was the limit probably represents a favorable in- 
stance. By choice of a suitable cell for each spectral region, 
the range from 2500 A to 9500 A can be covered with a limit 
of detection not greater than 10~ 7 erg/sec. 

Types of cells. Two general types of cells have been 
found useful in the physical laboratory. One is the photo- 
emissive cell, historically the oldest. In this type electrons 
are ejected from a metallic surface by the action of light and 



4 Biltz, M., Phys. Zeits., 34, 200 (1933). If the star image cited in Table I 
is assumed to be a round, uniformly illuminated spot 0.06 mm in diameter, 
the energy received at the plate is easily computed to be 0.25 erg/cm 2 , or 25 
times the figure given by Biltz. The difference may be ascribed to three 
factors: (1) Part of the radiation came in wave lengths to which the plate was 
insensitive. (2) The limit in stellar photography is set by lack of contrast 
between the star image and sky background. The sky brightness is so low 
that it does not affect other less sensitive detectors of radiation very seriously. 
(3) When the blackened area is very small, a higher density is required to 
make the image perceptible. Hubble, E., Astrophys. J., 76, 107 (1932); Mt. 
Wilson Contr. No. 453.

25, 80 (1935). 



400 PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS [Chap. X 

are collected on an electrode maintained at a positive poten- 
tial by an external battery. The other type is the photo- 
voltaic cell, a comparatively recent development. In these 
cells light causes a transfer of electrons across the rectifying 
boundary between two dissimilar materials, such as copper 
and copper oxide, or selenium and another metal. The 
current is sent through the external circuit entirely by the 
voltage generated within the cell, and no battery is required. 

A third type of light-sensitive device, the photoconductive 
cell, depends for its action on the change in resistance of 
certain materials, such as selenium, when exposed to light. 
Though greatly improved in recent years, these cells have 
not found much application in the physical laboratory. A 
serious drawback is the nonlinear response to light. 6 

Characteristics of emissive-type cells. The spectral 
sensitivity of various types of photoemissive cells is shown in 
Fig. 1. The relative height of the various curves is only 
approximately correct, since there is considerable individual 
variation in cells of the same type. The vertical scale is 
intended to represent the average emission of good-quality 
vacuum cells obtained from commercial manufacturers. 

The cesium oxide cells are sensitive to the greatest range 
of wave lengths and are therefore probably the type most 
generally useful in the laboratory. This type of sensitiza- 
tion was developed to meet the need for a cell that would 
have a high response to light from incandescent tungsten 
bulbs, in which most of the energy comes in the red and 
infrared. Cesium oxide cells are very widely used in com- 
mercial applications of the photoelectric cell, such as for the 
reproduction of sound in motion pictures. Indeed, since 
their introduction in about 1930, the production of emission 
cells of other types has become almost negligible. 

The cesium oxide cell has one drawback when it is used for 
measuring the light from very faint sources. It has rela- 
tively large dark current, due at least in part to thermionic

emission from the sensitive surface at room temperature. 
Currents as large as 10~ 9 ampere have been reported. 7 
Present-day cells, when of a design which minimizes insula- 
tion leakage over the bulb and base, usually have a dark 
current of the order of 10~ u to 10~ 12 ampere. If the photo- 
current is very much (say 1000 times) smaller than this, it

will be masked by unavoidable irregularities in the dark cur- 
rent. The dark current can be reduced to 10 -15 ampere or 
less by refrigerating the cell with solid carbon dioxide. This 
has been done by Hall 8 and Bennett 9 in their application of 
cesium oxide cells to the photometry of stars. Details of the 
design of such an arrangement are given on page 424. 
In certain applications, the high infrared sensitivity of the

cesium oxide cell is inconvenient. For example, in compar- 
ing the color of certain objects, it may be desired to measure 
the intensity through a blue filter. Almost all blue filters 
made of glass or gelatin are more or less transparent to the 
infrared, so that with a cesium oxide cell large error will be 
made unless an additional filter to remove the infrared is 
used. The standard filter for removing the infrared is a 
solution of copper salt. 10 Two special glass filters are also 
satisfactory. These are the Corning Glass Company's Aklo 
and the Jena BG-18. 11 

The potassium oxide cell is valuable in applications to 
colorimetry and photometry when infrared sensitivity is 
undesirable. Ordinary filters may be used with it, without 
particular attention to infrared leaks. It has a fair degree 
of red sensitivity, with a threshold at about 8000 A, and a 
higher green and blue sensitivity than the cesium oxide cell. 
The thermionic emission is negligible. Cesium-magnesium 
cells are also useful for applications of this type. The thresh- 
old for this type of surface is at about 7000 A. 

Potassium hydride cells are sensitive to a fairly narrow 
range of wave lengths, mainly in the blue, with a maximum 
at about 4400 A. Their sensitivity to white light and par- 
ticularly to light from incandescent tungsten is considerably 
lower than for cesium oxide cells. However, in the pho- 
tometry of stars, which are in general much hotter than in- 
candescent lights and give out correspondingly greater 
amounts of blue light, potassium hydride cells have been 
found extremely valuable. For this work, an important 
advantage is their extremely low dark current, limited, it 
seems, only by the insulation of the bulb. Smith 12 has 
reported a dark current of only 5 X 10 -18 ampere for a 
potassium hydride cell in a fused-quartz bulb. 

10 Gibson, K. S., J.O.S.A., 13, 267 (1926), recommends 57 g of CuSOv5H 2 
to 1 liter of water; about 2 cm is required. A transmission curve is given in 
Fig. 24, Chapter IX.

For the ultraviolet the cesium oxide cell can be used. For 
applications in which the cell must be sensitive only to the 
ultraviolet, several types of cells are available, with different 
thresholds. Sodium cells are sensitive mainly to wave 
lengths in the range 2000 A to 4000 A, with a slight response 
to visible light. For the shorter wave-length portion of the 
ultraviolet a thorium, titanium, or tungsten cathode may be 
used. Thorium is sensitive from 2500 A to 3600 -A, titanium 
from 2500 A to 3200 A, and tungsten from 1700 A to 2700 A. 
Insufficient data are available for plotting spectral response 
curves of these tubes along with those given in Fig. 1, but 
the response is believed to be comparable to that of a sodium 
cell at wave lengths below 3000 A. These cells are especially 
useful in investigations of the biological effects of radiation. 

In Table II is collected a representative list of photo- 
electric cells of the emission type obtainable from American 
manufacturers. When several cells which differ only as 
regards size of cathode or type of base are available, only 
one is listed. The sensitivity rating (except as otherwise 
noted) is based on the response to light from incandescent 
tungsten at a color temperature of 2870 °K., which has been 
tentatively adopted as a standard source for comparing 
photocells. This is roughly the operating temperature of a 
300-watt gas-filled tungsten bulb designed for general illumi- 
nation purposes. When tested with a bulb at a lower 
temperature, cesium oxide cells will give a slightly higher 
apparent rating, but the rating of the blue-sensitive cells 
will be affected unfavorably. For rough tests gas-filled 
Mazda bulbs of from 50 watts to 100 watts may be used. 
At normal voltage these lamps have an efficiency of approxi- 
mately 1.0 candle power/watt (within 10 to 20 per cent) and 
operate at about 2700°K. 13 

The insulation between cathode and anode is an important 
factor when a cell is to be used to measure a very faint source. 
If the insulation is not good enough, the dark current due to

* As far as is known, this type of cell is not now regularly produced by any 
American commercial manufacturer, although it might be obtained on a 
special order. Those used in astronomical photometry have been made by 
Professor J. Kunz, Department of Physics, University of Illinois. The 
General Electric Company, Ltd., Magnet House, Kingsway, London, W. C. 2,

leakage may be many times larger than the photocurrent. 
For example, in certain cells designed for use in the sound 
head of motion-picture projectors, in which the photocurrent 
may be on the order of 1 microampere, the two terminals 
come out to pins on a standard four-prong radio-tube base. 
In general, cells of this type are not satisfactory for currents 
smaller than about 10 -10 ampere. In some cells the connec- 
tion to either the cathode or the anode is made via a separate 
cap on the bulb, and thus a considerable length of clear glass 
bulb is interposed between the terminals to serve as insula- 
tion. Cells without a base in which the terminals come out 
through a common pressed seal are better than those with a 
base, but not as good as those in which there are two seals 
at opposite ends of the bulb. 

In many cases the leakage current over the surface of the 
bulb can be practically eliminated by a guard ring at a proper 
place on the cell. This can be made by wrapping a few 
turns of fine wire around the cell and painting with aquadag 14 
or a mixture of lampblack and mucilage. The guard ring 
should be connected to a point in the circuit such that the 
potential difference across the insulation on the cell will be as 
near zero as possible. In some processes of manufacture, 
particularly of cesium oxide cells, a thin deposit is left on the

inside walls of the bulb, which greatly reduces the insulation 
resistance. The obvious remedy is an internal guard ring, 
and some manufacturers regularly provide this feature on 
certain of their cells. 

In general, insulation leakage currents are greatly reduced 
by cooling, because of the quasi-electrolytic nature of such 
conduction. For instance, the dark current of an RCA 917 
cell fell from about 10~ 10 ampere to about 10 -13 ampere when 
cooled with dry ice. The latter current is not a serious 
detriment except when the highest sensitivity is required. It 
thus becomes possible to use an inexpensive commercial cell 
to measure rather faint sources. A suitable arrangement 
for refrigerating cells with dry ice is described on page 424. 

The manufacture of cells. The prospective user of photo- 
electric cells will find it by far the most economical procedure 
as regards both time and money to purchase the cells from 
an established manufacturer. The production of highly 
sensitive cathodes is still very much an art which has never 
been fully described in the literature and requires some 
experience to master. Most manufacturers will accept 
orders for special cells with internal guard rings or other 
modifications required in particular applications. 15 

Vacuum and gas-filled cells. In vacuum cells the anode 
merely collects all of the electrons ejected from the light- 
sensitive cathode. The current for a given light increases 
rapidly with voltage up to about 25 volts and then gradually 
becomes saturated and does not increase further. The 
introduction of an inert gas at a pressure of a few tenths of a

millimeter permits an amplification of the original photo- 
current due to ionization by collision. Fig. 2 shows the 
relation between the voltage and the current for the same 
sensitive surface in a vacuum and with gas. With increasing 
voltage the gaseous amplification factor increases until at a 
certain voltage a self -maintaining glow discharge sets in, 
which, if continued for more than a few seconds, may seri- 
ously damage the sensitive surface. The glow voltage is 
lower the greater the illumination. Thus a cell which is

gaseous amplification factor of 10 is about the maximum 
usually recommended. The gas pressure in commercial cells 
is usually adjusted so that 90 volts is the maximum safe 
voltage on the cell for illumination of the order of 0.1 lumen. 
However, when used with faint sources, this may be exceeded 
somewhat and an amplification factor of 20 to 40 realized. 
When a voltage increase of 10 volts doubles the response, the 
safe limit has been reached. Amplification factors as high 
as 600 have been reported, 16 but a gas cell becomes very 
unstable when too near the glow voltage.

408 PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS [Chap. X 

A protective resistance of at least 100,000 ohms 
should always be in the circuit of a gas-filled cell to limit 
the current to nondestructive values in case of a glow 
discharge. 

The speed of response of a vacuum cell is limited only by 
the transit time of the photoelectrons, though usually the 
amplifier sets the limit. Gas-filled cells, however, have a 
definite time lag. When used with a modulated light signal, 
the response falls off gradually at the higher audio fre- 
quencies, the reduction becoming serious at 10,000 cycles. 
Data on the frequency response characteristic are supplied 
by cell manufacturers, particularly for cells to be used in 
sound reproduction. 

When operated on the steep part of the current-voltage 
curve, gas cells may give a nonlinear response to light. The 
voltage across the cell is reduced when exposed to light by 
the amount of the potential drop in the external resistance, 
and with reduced voltage, the cell is less sensitive. On the 
other hand, the gaseous amplification factor is greater for 
more intense illumination, causing an error in the opposite 
sense. No general rule can be laid down; each situation 
must be analyzed separately. In most laboratory applica- 
tions, however, in which the intensity is usually low, diffi- 
culties with nonlinear response are less likely to be encoun- 
tered. In fact, most of the drawbacks of gas-filled cells 
become less serious when used with faint sources. Recently 
Stebbins and Whitford 17 calibrated a gas-filled potassium 
hydride cell over a thousandfold range in intensity at a con- 
stant cell voltage. The largest current was about 3 X 10 -12 
ampere. They found no departures from linearity signifi- 
cantly greater than the probable error, which was about 
1 per cent. 

Photoelectric currents are feeble enough at best, and the 
gain provided by gaseous amplification is often just the 
margin of safety between satisfactory and unsatisfactory

operation. However, when the light intensity is great 
enough, vacuum cells are to be preferred because of their 
greater stability. 

Photovoltaic cells. In its usual form the photovoltaic cell 
consists of a thin metallic disk, coated with a film of sensitive 
material, sealed in a moisture-proof case with a glass window, 
and provided with suitable terminals. On some cells the 
terminals are two pins spaced to fit two of the holes of a 
standard four-prong radio socket. Cells of the photovoltaic 
type are manufactured by the General Electric Company, 
G-M Laboratories, Inc., Westinghouse Electric and Manu- 
facturing Company (Photox), and Weston Electrical Instru- 
ment Corporation (Photronic cell).

external resistances. The total current generated by the 
light is believed to be proportional to the light intensity. 
However, this current divides between the internal and 
external resistance. The internal resistance of the cell 
is about 7000 ohms in the dark, decreasing rapidly with

increasing illumination. 18 As the figure shows, the result is 
a nonlinear current output unless the external resistance is 
quite small. With a low-resistance meter, however, the out- 
put is practically linear and amounts to 120 microamperes/ 
lumen for a tungsten lamp at 3000 °K.

of the cell may be modified to match that of the eye very 
closely. Such a filter is supplied by the makers of the cell. 
The photovoltaic cell, when used with a sensitive d'Arson- 
val galvanometer, gives very stable and reproducible deflec- 
tions. If the Photronic cell mentioned above were used 
with a galvanometer having a current sensitivity of 2 X 10 -10 
ampere /mm, 1 mm would correspond to 1.7 X 10~ 6 lumen. 
The sensitive area of the cell is about 0.012 square foot. 
From this it may be computed that 1 mm deflection would

correspond to the amount of light received by the cell from a 
standard candle at 85 feet. A slight gain might be realized 
by using a more sensitive galvanometer, but it is not worth 
while to push the sensitivity to the extreme limit, because of 
the comparative ease with which much smaller amounts of 
light may be measured with an emission-type cell and 
amplifier. 

Amplification of the output of photovoltaic cells is not 
feasible, because of their low voltage sensitivity. 19 Because 
of the high capacity (0.5 microfarad) between the termi- 
nals, the response to modulated light intensities falls 
rapidly with increasing frequency, and the cell is not well 
adapted to sound reproduction. The power sensitivity is 
high and a sensitive relay can be operated directly on the 
output if there is a change in illumination of 0.2 lumen or 
more. 20 In many applications of the photoelectric cell to 
automatic control mechanisms, in which only an on-and-off 
signal is required, this is a simple and convenient arrange- 
ment. 

For laboratory measurements, the photovoltaic cell is 
recommended in applications in which there is sufficient 
intensity available, because of its simplicity and compact- 
ness, and because it does not require an external battery. 

Amplification of photoelectric currents. Photoelectric 
cells of the emission type may be used with galvanometers 
down to about the same limit of light intensity as that given 
above for photovoltaic cells. For fainter sources some more 
sensitive current-measuring device must be used. Electrom- 
eters of various types can be used, and in certain applica- 
tions may be the most desirable instrument. In particular, 
the Lindemann electrometer, or the Cenco-Dershem modifi- 
cation of it, is useful when light weight and compactness are 
important considerations. In the last few years, however, it 
has increasingly been the practice to amplify small photo-

electric currents up to the level at which they can be read on 
a galvanometer. The advantages of amplification are that 
(1) currents which must be measured by the rate-of-drift 
method with an electrometer can be measured by the more 
convenient steady-deflection method, and (2) the amplifier 
is more rugged and portable than the electrometer. But 
for attaining the ultimate limit in measuring photoelectric 
currents, the Hoffmann electrometer is probably still the 
best instrument. 

In case the photoelectric current is varying rapidly with 
time, the variations can easily be amplified many thousand- 
fold by means of a multistage a.c. amplifier, the technique 
for which has been highly developed because of numerous 
applications in the radio, telephone, and motion-picture 
industries. In the laboratory, however, it is usually desired 
to measure the photoelectric current due to a steady source. 
Hence d.c. amplification must be used. 

Direct-current amplifiers. The fundamental circuit of a 
single-tube d.c. amplifier is shown in Fig. 5. The photo- 
current passes through a resistance R , and the resulting

voltage drop alters the grid potential of the tube. The 
consequent change in plate current is read on the galva- 
nometer. The normal plate current of the tube is balanced 
out by adjustment of Ri so that the galvanometer reads zero 
when there is no light on the cell. Since .Ri is usually at 
least fifty times the galvanometer resistance, the galva-

nometer will indicate very nearly the entire change in plate 
current. If i is the photocurrent, the galvanometer current 
ii is then i x = i Rogm, where g m is the mutual conductance of 
the tube. The mutual conductance, more correctly called 
the grid-plate transconductance, is defined by the relation 
g m = di v /de a , where i v is the plate current and e g is the grid 
voltage. To obtain high current amplification it is necessary 
to make R as great as possible. It is useless, however, to 
increase R indefinitely, because it is shunted by the grid-to- 
filament resistance of the tube itself. With most tubes 
designed for use in radio receivers this resistance is not over 
10 8 ohms. The instability of the plate current is such that 
it is not worth while to use a galvanometer with a sensitivity 
better than 10 -8 ampere/mm. Such a circuit is therefore 
limited to measuring currents greater than 10~ 12 ampere. 

The comparatively low value of the grid-to-filament 
resistance in ordinary tubes is due not so much to poor

known as the FP-54 was developed especially for the ampli- 
fication of small direct currents. It is made by the General 
Electric Company. The Western Electric Company makes 
a similar tube, known as the D-96475. These tubes have an 
inner space-charge grid to shield the control grid from positive 
ions emitted by the filament. They are operated at a very 
low plate voltage to avoid ionization of the residual gas.

sistance. The control grid is operated at — 3 volts, because 
the curve is nearly flat at that point. The slope of the plate- 
current curve gives the mutual conductance. The curvature 
of the plate-current curve is quite noticeable, and is sufficient 
to cause appreciable nonlinearity if the grid voltage changes 
by 0.1 volt, a rather large change in most applications.

Fig. 7. Circuit for amplification of photocurrents using the D-96475 tube. 

Fig. 7 gives in detail the constants of a simple circuit 
employing the D-96475 for the measurement of the photo- 
electric currents. By choosing a resistance R of the proper 
value, and varying the galvanometer shunt, a very wide 
range of currents may be covered. The calibration circuit 
in the control-grid lead provides a means of testing the 
sensitivity, which should be of the order of 100,000 mm/ 
volt for a galvanometer sensitivity of 4 X 10 -10 ampere/mm. 

The stability of the plate current in such a circuit of course 
determines the smallest current that may be measured. A 
slow drift in the galvanometer zero will not cause a serious 



416 PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS [Chap. X 

loss in accuracy if the rate is constant during the time of one 
observation, since it may easily be averaged out by taking 
alternate zeros according to a definite schedule. In certain 
applications of electrometer tubes, such as measurement of 
a particles, when continuous registration over long periods is 
required, a very low drift rate is necessary. In any case it is 
desirable to reduce drift as much as possible. 

Random fluctuations of the zero, on the other hand, place 
a definite limitation on the useful sensitivity of the amplifier. 
These may be due to external conditions, such as mechanical 
vibration, poor insulation, poor contacts, stray electric and 
magnetic fields, or residual atmospheric ions settling on the 
grid lead. By suitable precautions, disturbances due to 
such causes can be practically eliminated. There remain 
inherent and unavoidable fluctuations caused by variations 
in filament emission and by shot effect and Johnson effect 
(thermal noise) in the grid circuit. In actual practice, un- 
even filament emission is found to be unimportant compared 
to the two latter sources of fluctuations. A quantitative 
discussion of these factors is reserved for a later paragraph. 

Contrary to statements which have appeared in the litera- 
ture, battery potential fluctuations are not a limiting factor 
in using a simple circuit of the type shown in Fig. 7. The 
stability is determined in the grid circuit, as is shown by the 
fact that the zero is much steadier with the high resistance 
Ro shorted out. The effects of variable filament emission 
remain. To gauge the effect of the battery fluctuations only, 
the tube may be removed and replaced by fixed resistances 
equivalent to the filament resistance and to the static fila- 
ment-to-plate resistance. The galvanometer will then be 
perfectly steady, except possibly for a slow uniform drift, 
showing that there are no sudden changes in battery voltage 
large enough to affect the stability. 

One cause of drifts is temperature variation, which changes 
battery voltages and the resistance of various parts of the 
circuit. If the temperature is constant, the galvanometer in 
the circuit shown in Fig. 7 drifts slowly in the direction of 



Chap. X] 



PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS 



417 



decreasing plate current. This is caused mainly by a de- 
crease in the filament current as the battery discharges. The 
larger the filament battery the slower the drift — hence the 
paralleling of cells in Fig. 7. As soon as equilibrium is 
reached, the rate of drift is less than 1 mm/minute at a 
sensitivity of 100,000 mm/volt. For most laboratory meas- 
urements such a rate is not a serious drawback. 

The simplest method of controlling drift is to introduce a 
counterdrift whose rate can be adjusted. Hafstad 32 placed

a countercell in the filament circuit and bled it with a vari- 
able resistance. A smaller cell is required if the counter- 
drift is introduced in the plate circuit. An arrangement of 
this type, similar to one described by Bearden, 23 is shown in 
Fig. 8. Part of the voltage which balances out the plate 
current of the tube comes from the cell E u which is being 
discharged through R 7 . The discharge rate is set so that if 
all the voltage for balancing out were taken from Ei, the 
drift would be in the direction of increasing plate current. 
Then by varying the amount of voltage taken from the 
loaded and unloaded cell, the normal drift due to decreasing

PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS 



[Chap. X 



plate current may be compensated. The advantage of this 
method is that the drift rate may be changed immediately 
without altering anything in the circuit that requires some 
time to reach a new equilibrium. The cell E\ may be a 
flashlight cell, or if a rechargeable cell is desired, an Edison 
storage cell. In cases where the tube is to be operated con- 
tinuously over long periods, the cell E\ may be eliminated 
and the battery discharging resistor attached directly to the 
last cell of a storage battery. The drift rate is then regu- 
lated by varying the discharge current. This requires some 
patience to adjust. 

Numerous circuits have been devised with a view to 
making the plate current of a vacuum tube independent of 
small changes in supply voltage. The former two-tube 
circuits 24 required tubes with matched characteristics, which 
are often difficult to obtain. Recently practically all bal- 
anced circuits have consisted of a single tube in a suitable 
resistance network. 

The single-tube circuit originated by DuBridge and 
Brown 25 has been successfully used in many laboratories.

and the filament-to-plate resistance and filament-to-space- 
charge-grid resistance form two other arms. The resistance 
R 3 may be considered a part of the tube resistance. A 
condition that the galvanometer current be zero is obviously 

RiI P = R2I,. 

In order for this condition to remain satisfied when the bat- 
tery voltage changes, or the filament emission changes for 
any reason, it is further necessary that 

dl p _ Ri dl s 
dlf R2 dl f 

For these conditions to be satisfied in general, it would be 
necessary for the I v versus I f and 7 S versus I r curves to be 
straight lines intersecting at a common point on the 1/ axis. 
Of course, the tubes do not have this characteristic, but over 
short ranges the tangents to the I v and I s curves do satisfy 
this condition, and it is possible to adjust the resistances in 
the circuit so that this can be made to occur at approximately 
the rated filament current. 

The resistance -B3 is necessary to provide a voltage drop of 
2 volts, since the space-charge-grid voltage of the FP-54 is 
4 volts and the plate voltage is 6 volts. For the D-96475 
tube, in which both the space-charge-grid and the plate 
operate at 4 volts, it would be omitted. In a typical setup 
with the FP-54 tube, Re was 45 ohms, R z was 4000 ohms, R 2 
was 2000 ohms, and Rt was a 10,000-ohm rheostat, with R t ' 
a 50-ohm rheostat for fine adjustment. R A was a 50-ohm 
potentiometer. The procedure in balancing the circuit is as 
follows: With the galvanometer shunted to one tenth or 
one hundredth of its full sensitivity and Ri adjusted so that 
the galvanometer reads zero when I f is near its rated value, 
// is slowly varied by means of the rheostat R 5 . With the 
galvanometer connected so that a positive deflection is 
caused by a decrease in the plate current, the deflection 
should pass through a maximum value for some value of I f . 
If the galvanometer deflection goes off scale before the maxi- 



420 PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS [Chap. X 

mum is reached, it may be brought back by an adjustment 
of Ri. 

If the value // for maximum is not within a few per cent of 
the rated value for the tube, the adjustment of Ri and Rx will 
bring the balance point to a different value //. The adjust- 
ment is finally made with the galvanometer at full sensitivity. 
Each adjustment will require a few minutes' waiting for anew 
thermal equilibrium to be established. 

The advantage of this ingenious circuit is that any change 
in the filament emission due to variation in battery voltage 
or deactivation of the filament is compensated. Also short- 
period fluctuations in the filament emission are balanced out, 
and the stability with R shorted out is somewhat improved 
over that obtained with the circuit of Fig. 7. 

Some workers have experienced difficulty in obtaining the 
balanced condition for tubes of different characteristics. 
Penick 26 has given a thorough analysis of balanced circuits, 
with special application to the D-96475 electrometer tube. 
He suggests a modification of the DuBridge and Brown 
circuit which in effect amounts to attaching the leads from 
the plate and space-charge-grid leads of the bridge to sepa- 
rate taps on the resistance -R 4 . In practice this is best done 
by using two potentiometers in parallel. This introduces an 
additional element of flexibility in the circuit and enables 
a balance point to be reached for tubes of widely different 
characteristics. However, there are considerable individual 
variations in electrometer tubes, and sometimes with a 
particular tube it may not be possible to reach a balance 
point with reasonable values for the other circuit constants. 

The best type of circuit for a particular application must 
be decided upon the basis of the conditions of use. The 
limiting sensitivity obtainable is about the same for all types 
of circuits. A balanced circuit is probably preferable when 
the use is to be irregular or intermittent because of much 
shorter warm-up time. A simple uncompensated circuit 

26 Penick, D. B., Rev. Sci. Instruments, 6, 115 (1935). Full references to the 
literature are given. 



Chap. X] PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS 421 

requires several hours to reach equilibrium. However, if it 
is to be used daily, there is no objection to letting the filament 
run continuously. 

In applications in which the circuit is to be used for both 
steady deflections and rate-of-drift measurements, the bal- 
anced circuit becomes rather complicated, because whenever 
the control-grid bias is changed, in order to find equilibrium 
potential the entire circuit must be rebalanced. 

In order to reach high sensitivity by the steady-deflection 
method the resistance R must be made very large. If it is 
much larger than 10 u ohms, the time constant of the input 
circuit becomes unduly long, and considerable time is wasted 
in waiting for deflections to reach their final value. The 
highest sensitivity is best obtained by the rate-of-drift 
method. To do this the anode of the photoelectric cell (or 
other sources of the current to be measured) is connected 
directly to the control grid of the tube with no other resist- 
ance. A high-insulation switch free from contact potentials 
is necessary for grounding the grid. When the tube is 
operated at the rated control-grid voltage, the grid current is 
approximately 10 -15 ampere. If the grid is "floated" by 
opening the grounding switch, it will draw this current and 
drift in the direction of less negative grid potential. In 
order to eliminate this drift, the grid bias must be changed to 
such a value that the positive and negative components of 
the grid current are equal and the grid current is zero. When 
operating at this so-called "equilibrium potential," the grid 
resistance, as shown by the slope of the lower curve in Fig. 6, 
is considerably reduced but is still usually as high as 10 14 
ohms and is quite satisfactory for use in the rate-of-drift 
method. The equilibrium potential is found by observing 
the drift when the grounding switch is opened for various 
values of the control-grid potential until a value sufficiently 
near zero drift is reached. The galvanometer must be 
brought back to zero after each change in the grid bias, by 
adjustment of the resistance in the plate circuit. The pro- 
cedure for measuring a small photoelectric current is then 



422 PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS [Chap. X 

to observe the drift rate with the light alternately on and 
off. This may be done by timing the drift over a particular 
interval of the galvanometer scale, but better results will be 
obtained if the galvanometer deflections are continuously 
recorded photographically. The value for the slope of the 
drift curve does not then depend on observations at two 
particular points. In fact, in all measurements in which the 
inherent fluctuations set the observing limit, improved 
accuracy will be obtained with photographic registration. 26 " 

Measurements made by the rate-of-drift method may be 
connected with steady-deflection measurements by measur- 
ing the same current by both methods. In effect this con- 
stitutes a measurement of the capacity of the grid circuit. 

Experimental details. The photoelectric cell and elec- 
trometer tube must be enclosed in a light-tight metal box. If 
high sensitivity is required, the container should be evacu- 
ated in order to eliminate the effect of residual ions in the air 
caused by cosmic rays. A suitable form for the container 
consists of a brass cylinder with a light window on the side. 
The amplifying tube and photoelectric cell are best supported 
entirely from one end plate in order to facilitate removal for 
adjustment. The vacuum seal may be made with a rubber 
gasket. A vacuum of the order of 1 mm of mercury is 
sufficient. The necessary switching arrangements can be 
operated by means of cams on a shaft which turns through a 
conical ground joint in the end plate. A separate metal 
shield over the tube inside of the container is advisable, and 
this may be made to serve also as a light shield to screen the 
photoelectric cell from the light of the filament. In case 
the container is not evacuated, it should be kept dry by the 
use of calcium chloride or phosphorus pentoxide. 

A satisfactory design for mounting the cell and tube in an 
evacuated brass tank is shown in Fig. 10. The diagram is 
largely self-explanatory. The construction of vacuum tanks, 
valves, and gaskets is treated in Chapter III. 

26a A suitable optical arrangement for photographic recording of galva- 
nometer deflections is shown in Fig. 47, Chapter IX.

In both Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 is shown a convenient switching 
arrangement which provides the possibility of using any one 
of three grid resistors, or of floating the grid for rate-of-drift 
measurements. This design requires no other support for 
the sensitive grid lead than that furnished by the tube itself. 
Should other support be necessary, only the best insulating 
materials should be used. Amber or fused quartz is recom- 
mended. All insulating surfaces, including the photoelectric 
cell and the exterior of the amplifying tube, must be kept 
free from grease or dirt and should be handled as little as 
possible. They may be cleaned by swabbing with cotton 
moistened with 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. 

All parts of the circuit should be enclosed in metallic 
shielding. The various control resistances, the galvanom- 
eter shunt, and necessary meters may be mounted in a 
metal or metal-lined box such as that shown in Fig. 12.

between these various units, or the necessary wires may be 
pulled through a flexible metal hose. 27 

Whenever possible, all connections should be soldered, 
using only rosin flux. A flux made by dissolving rosin in 
alcohol will be found convenient; it may be applied with a 
brush. It is usually not necessary to solder the wires to the 
pins of the tube base, but a socket which grips the pins 
tightly must be used. The soldering of connections to the 
battery terminals is particularly important. 

The batteries should be kept in first-class condition; the 
tops should be kept clean and dry. They should be charged 
at a moderate rate. It will be found advantageous to oper- 
ate them only on the middle portion of the discharge curve. 

The resistances, rheostats, and potentiometers should be 
of good quality. Wire-wound resistors may be obtained 
from any radio supply house. General Radio Type 371 
potentiometers have been found satisfactory. Ohmite 
model H and model J units are also to be recommended. 
The inexpensive small wire-wound potentiometers of the 
type used in radios are not above suspicion, but Clarostat 
controls have been found entirely satisfactory by some 
workers. The high resistances to be used in the control-grid 
circuit are supplied commercially with values up to 10 12 
ohms. 28 These resistors have proved so satisfactory that it 
is not worth while for the worker to attempt to make his own. 

In certain applications, in which portability is required or 
vibration makes it difficult to use a sensitive galvanometer, 
an additional stage of amplification may be necessary. 
DuB ridge 29 used a 112A triode for the second stage and 
obtained an over-all current amplification of 4 X 10 7 . The 
indicator was a microammeter. The design of the second 
stage is not critical, and almost any tube with a high mutual 
conductance is satisfactory. However, for most laboratory

frequently by selection a tube may be found which has a grid

characteristics in this respect. Dunning 31 has recommended 
the Western Electric 259-B screen grid tube. MacDonald 32

The grid current of a tube is often the most important 
characteristic in choosing a tube to amplify small currents or 
small voltage. The following procedure is convenient in 
obtaining data for plotting the grid-current curve : The plate 
current is plotted as a function of the grid voltage in the 
usual way, first with no resistance in the grid circuit and 
then with a high resistance in series. The horizontal differ- 
ence between the two curves represents the potential drop 
in the resistance due to the grid current, and by dividing this 
voltage difference by the value of the resistor, the grid 
current in amperes is found. A shielded box is necessary. 

Characteristic curves for the RCA 38 pentode from John- 
son's data are shown in Fig. 13. This probably represents 
the results for a selected tube. From the slope of the lower 
curve it is found that the grid resistance at — 2 volts is 
10 12 ohms. At equilibrium potential this is reduced to 
5 X 10 10 ohms. 

Gabus and Pool 33 found that the RCA 954 acorn pentode 
can be operated in such a way as to have a very low grid 
current and correspondingly high input resistance. The 
No. 3 grid, normally used as the suppressor, is used as the 
control grid. Owing to the peculiar construction of the 
tube, this grid is very well insulated. The No. 1 grid, 
normally the control grid, is connected to the cathode. 
The No. 2 grid, normally the screen grid, is operated at 
a positive potential and acts as in the electrometer tube 
to protect the control grid from positive ions emitted by 
the cathode. 

A particular 954 tube tested under conditions similar to 
those recommended by Gabus and Pool had the following 
characteristics: Heater voltage, 4 volts; grid No. 1 connected 
to cathode; grid No. 2 at + 13.5 volts; grid No. 3 at — 4 
volts; plate at + 6 volts; plate current, 60 microamperes; 
mutual conductance, 100 microamperes/volt; plate resist- 
ance, 35,000 ohms; amplification factor, 3.5; grid current, 
4 X 10~ 13 ampere.

For many applications in measuring currents down to 10 -13 
ampere, any of the above-mentioned tubes will be found 
quite satisfactory and much less expensive than electrometer 
tubes. 

High-gain direct-current amplifiers. Direct-coupled 
multistage d.c. amplifiers similar to the familiar a.c. ampli- 
fiers have been used very little because of the necessity of a 
separate power supply for each stage and because of difficul- 
ties with cumulative drift and instability. 

Horton 34 has described an ingenious circuit in which 
extremely high gain is realized by utilizing one high-mu

pentode as the load resistance for another. In this way high 
amplification can be obtained without the very high plate 
supply voltage that would be necessary if a pure ohmic 
resistance were used for the load. The circuit is shown in 
Fig. 14. 

All plate potentials are supplied by a 180-volt battery, and 
the insulation between the heater and cathode of these tubes 
is sufficiently good that a common heater battery may be 
used. The over-all mutual conductance of this three-tube 
amplifier is about 4.5 mhos. If the amplifier is to work into 
a high-impedance load, such as a cathode-ray oscillograph, 
the type 89 output tube may be omitted and the load con-

430 PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS [Chap. X 

nected directly between the cathode of the second pentode 
and the 90-volt tap of the plate battery. In this case the 
voltage amplification is about 2500. Because of the capacity 
shunt through the heaters, the circuit has a poor response for 
high audio frequencies. In a similar circuit described by 
Schmitt, 36 in which separate heater batteries are used, this 
limitation is largely removed. Circuits of this type have 
found special application in the measurement of physio- 
logical potentials in which the resistance in the input circuit 
is low. Since the 77 tube (and similar high-gain pentodes) 
have a rather low grid-to-filament resistance, it is advisable 
to add a preliminary stage when measuring photoelectric 
currents. This would consist of an electrometer tube or 
other low-grid-current tube, operated from separate bat- 
teries. With such a combination a stable current amplifica- 
tion of 10 10 is possible, and the indicating instrument may 
be a milliammeter. 

Alternating-current amplifiers. One great advantage of 
an a.c. amplifier is that all the tubes of a multistage amplifier 
may be operated from a common power supply. The signal 
is transmitted from one stage to the next by means of a 
condenser or transformer, which, while providing insulation 
against steady potentials, offers a low impedance path for 
a.c. signals. Since only rapid variations are passed along, 
such an amplifier is insensitive to drifts in the plate current 
of any tube, and to gradual changes in the supply voltage. 
The characteristics of a.c. amplifiers have been treated so 
extensively elsewhere 36 that they will be considered only 
briefly here. The discussion will be limited to resistance- 
capacity coupling.

line, rectified and filtered in the usual manner to provide the 
necessary d.c. voltages. 

In order for the coupling condensers Ci to perform their 
function of transmitting the voltage variation of the plate 
of one tube to the grid of the next, their impedance must be 
small compared with the associated grid resistor Ri. The 



432 PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS [Chap. X 

reactance of a condenser in ohms is given by the well-known 
formula X = l/(2ir/C), where / is the frequency in cycles per 
second and C is the capacity in farads. A simple computa- 
tion shows that when C\ = 0.02 microfarad, the reactance 
becomes equal to 500,000 ohms, the value of the grid re- 
sistor .Ri, at a frequency of 16 cycles. This, then, is roughly 
the low-frequency cutoff of the above amplifier. 

The high-frequency cutoff is determined by the tube 
capacities shunting the plate-load resistors and grid resistors. 
At high frequencies, the coupling condenser has negligible 
impedance, so that the coupling resistors may be considered 
to be in parallel. Considering first the photocell circuit, the 
resistors Ri and R\ have a resistance in parallel of 333,000 
ohms. The capacity shunting this is the sum of the capacity 
of the photocell, the connections, and the dynamic input 
capacity of the first tube. The dynamic input capacity is 
given by the expression 

c = Co + c + [i + M«i/(fl, + #i)]c„, 

where C is the capacity of the photoelectric cell and connec- 
tions, Cgf is the grid-to-cathode capacity of the tube, C eP is 
the grid-to-plate capacity, n is the amplification factor of the 
tube, R P is the plate resistance of the tube, and R t is the 
plate-load resistance. In a screen-grid tube, such as the 
6C6, the grid-to-plate capacity is very small, and the last 
term is therefore unimportant. The grid-to-cathode ca- 
pacity is about 6 micro-microfarads. The total capacity 
may be roughly 15 micro-microfarads, which has a reactance 
equal to 333,000 ohms at a frequency of 34,000 cycles. This 
is the high-frequency cutoff for the input circuit. If a gas- 
filled cell is used, its lower response at high frequencies must 
of course be taken into account. 

The situation in the coupling between two stages follows 
the same general reasoning. In place of the capacity of the 
photocell there is the plate-to-cathode capacity of the tube 
delivering the signal to the coupling network. Also, the 
dynamic plate resistance of the tube is in parallel with the 



Chap. X] PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS 433 

resistors of the coupling network. The high-frequency 
cutoff may be regulated by attaching a shunting condenser 
to either the plate-load resistor or the grid resistor. This 
has been analyzed by Johnson, 37 who showed that by proper 
choice of coupling and shunting condensers, an amplifier 
may be fairly sharply tuned to a single frequency. 

The necessary negative voltage for the grid of each tube is 
obtained by a self-bias resistor in the cathode lead. If the 
a.c. variations in plate current are allowed to pass through 
this resistor, the grid bias will be altered in such a direction 
as to produce a serious degenerative effect, and the ampli- 
fication is much reduced. Consequently the bias resistor is 
shunted by a by-pass condenser, which must provide a low- 
impedance path for the a.c. component of the plate current. 
To keep the impedance less than that of the bias resistor at 
the lowest frequencies amplified, a rather large capacitance 
is sometimes required, but inexpensive low-voltage electro- 
lytic condensers are available for the purpose. 

Some care is necessary to prevent regenerative coupling 
of the first and last stages through the common power 
supply, the result of which is to produce a type of oscillation 
known as motorboating. The remedy is a decoupling filter 
of the resistance-capacity type in voltage lead to the photo- 
cell, and to the screen grid and plate of each tube except the 
power tubes. The principle to be followed is that the con- 
denser in each filter unit should offer an impedance to the 
signal about 10 times less than its associated resistor at the 
lowest frequency passed by the amplifier. This is equivalent 
to the requirement that the time constant RC of each filter 
unit be 10 times longer than the time constant of the grid 
coupling condenser and resistor. For the amplifier shown in 
Fig. 15 the time constant of the coupling circuits is 0.01 
second throughout. The time constant of the plate and 
screen-grid decoupling filters of the 6C6 tube (-R 6 C 4 ) is 
0.2 second, thus more than meeting the requirement. It is 
worth while to have a good margin of safety in the filters for 

37 Johnson, E. A., Physics, 7, 130 (1936). 



434 PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS [Chap. X 

the photocell and first tube, which are, of course, most 
sensitive to feedbacks. All such filters also act to eliminate 
any ripple in the rectified d.c. voltage from the power pack. 
Shielding of the photocell and first tube is necessary to 
eliminate undesirable pickup. 

The above-described amplifier is illustrative of the general 
design of a.c. amplifiers. For detecting very small light 
intensities, additional precautions must be taken, with 
special attention given to the first stage. A grid resistor of 
high value is used and the cell connected directly to the grid 
without a coupling condenser. A tube with low grid current 
is desirable, but an electrometer tube is ruled out because of 
its very low amplification factor and its sensitivity to micro- 
phonic disturbances. The RCA 38 or the Western Electric 
259B operated at reduced voltages is probably the most 
satisfactory tube for the first stage. Careful shielding is of 
course necessary. Each tube with its coupling resistors and 
condenser should be in a separate metal compartment, with 
an adjacent enclosure for the associated bias resistor and 
decoupling filters. The tube for the output stage must be 
selected with special reference to its load. The next to the 
last tube is usually of a type intermediate between a voltage 
amplifier and a power amplifier. Johnson and Neitzert 38 
have described an amplifier for small a.c. voltages which 
used RCA 38 pentodes at reduced voltages for all stages 
except the output. Separate plate batteries are used for 
each stage, but the plate current is low enough so that small 
units can be used. They may therefore be placed in the 
same compartment with the tube. Difficulties with regen- 
erative coupling through the plate power supply are thus 
eliminated. Dunning, 39 in a paper on amplifiers for detect- 
ing single ionizing particles, gives many practical sugges- 
tions.

determine the smallest signal that may be detected have 
long gone by the name of "noise," a term which is convenient 
even when there is no conversion of the currents into sound. 
When extraneous disturbances due to vibration, poor shield- 
ing, poor insulation, poor connections, and the like are 
eliminated by suitable precautions, there remain three in- 
herent sources of noise, originating in the first tube and its 
input circuit: 

1. Thermal noise in the grid resistor. 

2. Shot effect of currents in the grid circuit. 

3. Tube noise. 

It is important to the laboratory worker to be able to 
calculate the expected noise voltage in a particular circuit, 
or he may erroneously attribute the noise to an extraneous 
disturbance and waste much time in attempting to improve 
something that cannot be improved, except possibly by 
redesigning the circuit. Pearson 40 has published a discus- 
sion of the subject and has given data on low-noise tubes 
made by the Western Electric Company.

ance R as a result of thermal agitation of charge within it is

where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute tempera-

distortion, the expression for thermal noise becomes, for a 
temperature of 300 °K., 41 

E? =1.64xlO- 2 ° J R(/ 2 -/ 1 ). 

As an example, we may compute that the thermal-noise 
voltage across a resistance of 1 megohm connected to an 
amplifier which has a band width of 10,000 cycles (that is, 
the audio-frequency range) would be 13 microvolts. 

The mean square voltage due to shot fluctuations of the 
grid current is

EI = MM 2 fj 



+ 4tt 2 R 2 C 2 P' 



where e is the electronic charge and I g is the sum of the 
absolute values of the positive and negative components 
of the grid current. 

The same equation applies for the shot effect of the photo- 
current from vacuum cells. In gas-filled cells each photo- 
electron releases an average charge fx g e, where ix g is the 
gaseous amplification factor. For rough computation fj. g e 
may be used as the unit of charge in the formula, but Kings- 
bury 42 found that actually the noise is somewhat greater 
than that computed on this assumption. 

Tube noise cannot be less than the thermal noise in the 
internal plate resistance. A variety of factors serve to make 
it several times this theoretical minimum. The usual way 
of rating tubes is to give the resistance which, if placed in the 
grid circuit, would give the same noise voltage in the output 
as that produced by the tube itself. Low-noise tubes have 
an equivalent resistance of from 4000 ohms to 40,000 ohms. 
Tube noise is unimportant in amplifiers designed for ampli- 
fication of photocurrents, since the resistance in the grid 
circuit is practically always much higher than these values. 



41 Boltzmann's constant k = 1.37 X 10 -16 erg/degree. At 300°K., or room 
temperature, kT = 0.41 X 10~ 13 erg = 0.41 X lO" 20 joule. The latter unit is, 
of course, the proper one to use in connection with coulombs, volts, amperes, 
and farads. The electronic charge e = 1.6 X 10~ 19 coulomb.

Chap. X] PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS 437 

When measuring very small currents with an electrometer 
tube, the grid resistor is made very large, or the floating-grid 
method is used. Under these conditions, where the circuit 
itself, rather than the galvanometer, determines the speed of 
response, the equations for thermal noise and shot noise take 
on a simple form. As shown by Hafstad, 43 the following 
relations then hold : 

and 

— pj 7? 

It is to be noted that the thermal noise is independent of 
resistance and is therefore a very general limitation on all 
electrometers. If C = 10 -n farad, a practical minimum for 
the grid circuit, including photocell and connections, the 
thermal noise for 300°K. may be calculated to be 20 micro- 
volts. If R = 2 X 10 11 ohms and I g = 10" 15 ampere, the 
computed shot noise is 1.3 microvolt, negligible in compari- 
son with thermal noise. The resultant uncertainty in a 
current measurement is 10~ 16 ampere. 

However, if a resistance of 5 X 10 10 ohms or less is used 
with a 6-second galvanometer, the galvanometer limits the 
speed of response, an effect equivalent to increasing the 
capacity. The observed noise voltage is then reduced to 
about 8 to 10 microvolts. A large capacity in the grid 
circuit would also reduce the noise voltage, but the deflection 
time would be increased by just enough to make the precision 
remain the same. 

When the tube is operated with the grid at the equilibrium 
potential, R is the input resistance of the tube itself, about 
10 u ohms, and I g has two components, each of 10~ 16 ampere. 
The computed shot noise is then 40 microvolts. The thermal 
noise is of course unchanged from the previous case. With 
a total noise voltage of V40 2 + 20 2 = 45 microvolts, the 
uncertainty in any measurement of charge then amounts to

438 PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS [Chap. X 

4 X 10~ 16 coulomb, or, for a collection time of 1 minute, an 
uncertainty in the current of 7 X 10 -18 ampere. In this 
case it is advantageous to have a low capacity. These are 
theoretical limits, but with reasonable care they may be 
realized in practice. 

Applications of Photoelectric Cells 

General remarks on photoelectric photometry. The most 
important laboratory use of the photoelectric cell is in 
photometry. Used properly, it is capable of giving results 
of high precision. It should be remembered, however, that 
very few cells have a constant sensitivity. Both the abso- 
lute sensitivity and the color response may change with 
time. For this reason, in careful measurements the photo- 
electric cell should be called upon only to make comparisons 
between a standard and an unknown source. Some cells are 
subject to fatigue when exposed to a bright light. If the 
linear relation between current and light intensity is to be 
depended on over a range of more than two- or threefold, it 
must be tested. The inverse-square law offers a convenient 
method. 

If the light is to be projected on the sensitive surface by an 
optical system, the illuminated area should not be too small. 
An out-of-focus image about 1 cm in diameter is satisfactory. 
The light from different successive sources should cover the 
same area as nearly as possible. This reduces errors from 
local variations in sensitivity on the surface. 

There are three general methods in photoelectric photom- 
etry: 

1. Substitution method. The cell is exposed alternately 
to the standard source and to the unknown, and the relative 
deflections noted. This is the simplest and most direct 
method and is capable of giving excellent results. Of course 
it depends on the linearity of the cell and the current- 
measuring instrument. 

2. Balanced-cell method. Two cells are connected in 
opposition, and the intensity of either the standard or the 



Chap. X] PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS 439 

unknown is reduced by suitable means until there is a bal- 
ance. Although the method can be made very sensitive to 
unbalance, there is a fundamental objection to depending on 
the constancy of the two cells over any extended period. 

3. Flicker method. The two sources shine alternately in 
rapid succession on the cell. The intensity of the brighter is 
cut down by a suitable intensity reducer until the flicker is 
zero. The amplifier may be of the a.c. type. A 6E5 tuning 
indicator ("magic eye") makes a very satisfactory detector 
of the minimum. 44 This is an excellent method, because the 
linearity of the cell and amplifier is not an issue. 

When used in heterochromatic photometry, the photo- 
electric cell may give a judgment of relative brightness 
entirely different from that given by the eye, owing to the 
difference in spectral response. A cell with a spectral- 
response curve like that of the eye must be used if the visual 
standards of brightness are to be carried over without 
modification. The Westinghouse Photox cell meets this 
requirement very closely without the addition of any filters. 
The Weston Electrical Instrument Company supplies a suit- 
able filter for use with the Photronic cell when a response 
curve like that of the eye is required. 

For certain kinds of colorimetric measurement, the relative 
intensity through filters of various colors can give much 
useful information. Examples are the whiteness of paper 45 
and the color temperature of a lamp 46 or a star. 47 However, 
such results are so dependent on the particular cell and 
particular filters used that they can be relied on only if 
continually checked against some kind of standard. The

infrared transparency of practically all glass and gelatin 
filters mentioned on page 402 must be borne in mind. 

Spectrophotometry. The first requisite in photoelectric 
spectrophotometry is a good monochromator. A double 
monochromator is to be preferred because of the greatly 
reduced stray light of other wave lengths than the one being 
used. 48 

The principal spectrophotometric measurements made in 
the laboratory involve spectral-radiation curves of luminous 
sources, spectral-transmission curves, and spectral-reflectance 
curves. For spectral-radiation curves, the thermocouple is 
preferable to the photoelectric cell because it measures 
energy directly. If, however, the intensity is too low for the 
thermocouple, a photoelectric cell may be used, provided its 
spectral-sensitivity curve is accurately known, so that 
corrections to get the energy may be applied for each wave 
length. The spectral-sensitivity curve for the cell can be 
determined by comparison with a thermocouple, using a 
bright light as the source for the monochromator. This is 
the general method for obtaining the curves shown in Fig. 1. 

Spectral-transmission curves of filters, for example, may 
be very easily determined with a monochromator and a 
photoelectric cell. The intensity with the filter in and out 
of the beam gives the percentage transmission for each wave 
length. If the cell cannot be placed close enough to the slit 
to receive all of the exit beam, an additional lens is necessary. 
A minor adaptation enables absorption cells to be introduced 
into the beam for investigating the spectral-absorption 
curves of solutions. 49 Measurements of specular reflecting 



48 Preston, J. S., Journ. Sci. Instruments, 13, 368 (1936), has described a 
simple method of eliminating errors due to stray light in a monochromator. 
Shutters which may occult half of the slit length are fitted to the entrance and 
exit slit. A reading is taken with the shutters set to let the light go through. 
Then one shutter is reversed, and any light coming through is stray light, for 
which appropriate corrections may be made.

power may be carried out in the same way, except that it 
will, of course, be necessary to move the photocell when 
shifting from the direct to the reflected beam. 

For determinations of diffuse reflectance it is customary to 
illuminate the object at 45° incidence and observe along a 
line normal to the surface. The reflectance is measured 
relative to that of some standard material, such as mag- 
nesium carbonate. The fluorescence of certain materials 
causes difficulty, which can be eliminated only by having the 
reflection occur before the light beam passes through the 
monochromator. 

All of the above-mentioned methods of spectrophotometry 
involve the linear response of the photocell and the current- 
measuring instrument. In practical cases this is not likely to 
cause appreciable error, but in precision work the linearity 
must be investigated. Mention should be made of the Hardy 
automatic recording spectrophotometer, 50 which works on 
the flicker principle and is thus independent of the cell and 
amplifier characteristics and variations in light intensity. 
This instrument is adaptable to many kinds of measure- 
ments and gives very accurate results. It is manufactured 
commercially by the General Electric Company. 

Densitometers. In photographic photometry it is neces- 
sary to have some means of measuring the density of the 
photographic deposit. The photoelectric cell has found wide 
use as the light-sensitive unit of objective densitometers. 
Since photographic photometry consists of interpolation 
between standards whose intensity ratio is known, spec- 
tral sensitivity and exact linear response are not crucial 
matters. 

For sensitometry of photographic materials, when an area 
several millimeters square is of uniform density, good results 
can be obtained by a very simple arrangement without any 
optical system at all. An automobile headlight is mounted

12 to 18 inches above a flat opaque screen with a rectangular 
aperture of the desired size cut in it. A photovoltaic cell is 
mounted directly behind the aperture and connected to a 
galvanometer. The plate is best laid on the aperture emul- 
sion side down to reduce scattering effects. Miss Mohler 
and Miss Taylor 61 have described a reflection densitometer 
almost equally simple and easy to construct. Difficulties 
with stray light, and the effect of scattering in the emulsion 
will, however, be reduced if a simple projection system is 
introduced. 

For many problems it is desired to know the density on a 
very small area of the plate — hence the term micropho- 
tometer for densitometers which are designed for such

photometers using photovoltaic cells. The optical system 
of the Lange instrument is shown in Fig. 16. The con- 
densing lens forms an image of the lamp filament in the 
principal plane of the microscope objective, which is ad- 
justed to give a sharp image of the slit in the plane of the 
emulsion. The projected image of the slit may be made as 
narrow as 0.01 mm. The instrument is capable of giving 
rather high resolution.

Chap. X] PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS 443 

The optical design and other features of microphotometers 
have been reviewed by Harrison. 64 To eliminate errors 
caused by scattered light, it is customary to use at least two 
slits in high-resolution instruments. In order to obtain 
sufficient sensitivity with reasonable speed of response, it is 
necessary to use an emission-type cell and amplifier. For the 
amplifier an RCA 38 pentode, connected as in Fig. 5, is satis- 
factory. 55 Suitable operating conditions and circuit con- 
stants are as follows: Heater, 6 volts from storage battery. 
Control grid, — 1.5 volts; screen grid, + 6 volts; plate, 
+ 12 volts; all from small radio batteries. Plate current, 
60 microamperes. Mutual conductance, 150 microamperes/ 
volt. Grid resistor, 10 8 to 10 9 ohms. Galvanometer, 5 X 
10 -8 ampere/mm. A cesium oxide vacuum photocell is 
recommended. 

Measurements of the transmission of solutions as a func- 
tion of depth and concentration can also be made advan- 
tageously by photoelectric methods. Many procedures for 
chemical analysis which formerly used visual methods are 
now carried out with increased precision by employing a 
photoelectric cell. 66 

The light absorption of a solution is a logarithmic function 
of the concentration. Over a certain range the density of a 
photographic plate is a logarithmic function of the intensity. 
It would therefore be convenient to have an amplifier with a 
logarithmic response in order to make a direct-reading 
densitometer. Hunt 57 found that a remote cutoff tube such 
as the type 78 can be made to have an accurately logarithmic 
response over a voltage range of about tenfold. By using 
three tubes in cascade, he was able to extend this range to 
over a thousandfold. This arrangement is for alternating-

current voltages only. Miiller and Kinney 68 have applied 
this principle to measuring the concentration of solutions. 
They report that the open circuit e.m.f. of a Weston Pho- 
tronic cell is also a logarithmic function of intensity. 

Amplification of small galvanometer deflections. The 
ultimate sensitivity of a moving-coil galvanometer is set by 
the Brownian movement. Because of the limitations of the 
optical system it is difficult to realize this limit in a galva- 
nometer with a reasonably short period. Moll and Burger 69

only a few seconds of arc was amplified and read on a second 
galvanometer. More recently, amplification schemes using 
photoelectric cells 60 have come into use, with some improve- 
ment in the speed of response. 

The simplest method of amplification involves a balanced 
photovoltaic-cell arrangement. The sensitive disk of a 
Weston Photronic cell is removed from the case. This may 
be done by unscrewing the back, warming gently, if neces- 
sary, to soften the pitch seal. The conducting layer on the

top surface is divided into two parts by scratching a line 
along a diameter of the disk with a sharp instrument. Any 
loose particles must be brushed away. If this process is 
carried out properly, the two halves of the top conducting 
layer will be insulated from each other. Fig. 17 shows the 
optical arrangements. An automobile headlight bulb is 
focused on the mirror of the primary galvanometer by a 
simple lens, in the plane of which is a rectangular slot. The 
galvanometer lens forms an image of the illuminated slot on 
the divided disk of the photovoltaic cell. The two halves of 
the top conducting layer are connected to the secondary 
galvanometer, which indicates the difference in the illumi- 
nation on the two sides of the center line. A distance of 
1 or 2 feet between the photocell and the primary galva- 
nometer is sufficient. The secondary galvanometer may 
be placed wherever it is convenient. 

A current amplification of 200 is easily obtained with such 
an arrangement, which is sufficient to make the Brownian 
motion quite noticeable. Another application would be to 
couple two short-period, low-sensitivity galvanometers by 
such a device to form a high-sensitivity combination with 
rapid response. The over-all linearity is, of course, open to 
suspicion and must be tested. 

Thyratrons. The introduction of a gas into a hot-cathode 
tube greatly increases the power it can handle, owing to the 
neutralization of space charge by the positive ions formed. 
However, the grid-control characteristic is quite different 
from that of a high-vacuum tube. With the grid sufficiently 
negative, the tube is nonconducting. At a certain critical 
grid potential, whose value depends on the plate voltage, the 
discharge starts, and the tube is said to "fire." The grid 
then loses control of the plate current because of a sheath of 
positive ions around it. The discharge can be stopped only 
by removing the plate voltage. The voltage drop in the 
tube is practically independent of current and amounts to 
about 15 volts. The current must be limited by resistance 
in the external circuit to a safe value. 



446 



PHOTOELECTRIC CELLS 



[Chap. X 



The name thyratron 61 was first applied to these tubes only 
by the General Electric Company, but is coming into general 
use. Other terms sometimes used are gaseous triode and 
grid-controlled rectifier. The Westinghouse Lamp Company 
and the RCA Manufacturing Company also make tubes of 
this type. The gases used are argon and mercury vapor. 
Mercury-vapor tubes have the disadvantage, which is, how- 
ever, usually not serious, that the characteristics are a func- 
tion of the ambient temperature. Argon tubes are not 
subject to this variation, but are limited in their power- 
handling ability. The General Electric FG-81, the largest 
argon-filled tube, is rated at 0.5 ampere maximum average 
plate current and 180 volts maximum plate voltage. 

In most applications gaseous triodes are used with an 
alternating plate voltage. During the negative half of the 

cycle the grid regains control. 
The output is then a pulsat- 
ing direct current. Tubes may 
be used in pairs if full-wave 
operation is desired. 

The simplest application is 
as a relay. As compared to a 
mechanical relay, the gaseous 
triode requires much less power 
to operate, is faster and quieter, 
and has no contacts to pit, 
wear, or stick. Fig. 18 shows 
a gaseous triode used as the 
relay in a thermostat controlled by a mercury thermometer. 
A load of 2 kilowatts may be switched on and off with a 
current at the mercury contact of a few microamperes. The 
mercury is thus protected from contamination due to 
sparking. 

This particular application is merely illustrative. The 
control may be exercised by a photoelectric cell, and the load

may be a light, a motor, or a magnet. If response to even 
smaller grid power is required, a four-electrode tube known 
as a shield-grid thyratron is available. 62 

Continuous variation of the average plate current between 
zero and full value may be obtained by a phase-shift circuit, 
shown in Fig. 19. The phase of the alternating grid voltage 
is varied by the relative values of C and R. If R is very 
large, the grid voltage is 180° out of phase with the plate 
voltage, and the tube is always nonconducting. If R is zero 
or very small, the grid volt- 
age is in phase with the plate 
voltage, and the tube fires at 
the beginning of each positive 
half -cycle and carries the maxi- 
mum current. At an inter- 
mediate value, the grid volt- 
age will reach the critical po- 
tential at some time during 
the positive half-cycle, and 
the tube conducts for the re- 
mainder of the half -cycle. A 
smooth and fairly linear variation of the average current 
is thus possible. The resistance R may be a vacuum tube 
or a photoelectric cell. 

In Fig. 20 is shown a phase-shift circuit for maintaining a 
constant temperature in a furnace. 63 In a test, the tempera- 
ture of a furnace at approximately 880°C. was held constant 
within 0.06°C. The temperature is measured by a thermo- 
couple. (A resistance thermometer would do as well.) The 
potentiometer is set to balance at the desired constant tem- 
perature. An automobile headlight bulb is imaged on the 
galvanometer mirror by the lens Li. The galvanometer 
lens L 2 forms an image of L\ on a V-shaped slot in front of 
the photocell. The amount of light reaching the cell (which 
should be of the gas-filled type) determines the current

through the thyratron and thus regulates the furnace tem- 
perature. .Ri is in parallel with the regulator circuit and 
carries most of the heater current, thus making it possible to 
use a smaller tube. -B 2 limits the current through the tube to 
its rated maximum value. C may be a 200 micro-microfarad 
variable condenser. 

This arrangement is an example of a type of control mecha- 
nism that will be found generally useful in the laboratory.

It differs from the simple on-and-off control provided by 
relays in that the correcting influence approaches zero gradu- 
ally as the error diminishes, and "hunting" is thereby 
eliminated. The same principle is applicable to devices for 
maintaining constant speed, constant current, or constant 
voltage. With two lights and two photocells, it may be used 
to control a motor which will balance a bridge or a scale, or 
perform any other "centering" operation. 64
