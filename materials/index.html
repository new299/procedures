CHAPTER XIII 

Notes on the Materials of Research 

Alkali metals. One of the alkali metals may be required 
for the sensitive surface of a photocell or as a thin-film filter 
for ultraviolet light; or in the vapor phase the metal may be 
used for the demonstration of the phenomenon of resonance 
radiation. For these and other applications we will outline, 
briefly, some of the ways of manipulating these very reactive 
metals. 

The alkali metal may be prepared from the alkali chloride, 
reduced with calcium metal in an evacuated glass tube: 

2ATC1 + Ca -> 2M + CaCl 2 . (1) 

The reaction progresses in the indicated direction at elevated 
temperatures on account of the removal of the free alkali 
metal, M, by evaporation. This reaction may be varied: A 
chromate of the alkali metal may be used instead of the 
chloride, and zirconium metal may be used instead of cal- 
cium. The reaction applies to the preparation of all the 
alkali metals, with the exception of lithium, which reacts 
with the glass or quartz; lithium is best reduced from its 
chromate with zirconium metal in an iron apparatus. 

We will consider, in detail, how potassium may be pre- 
pared by the reaction indicated in Eq. 1. Pulverized 
potassium chloride and calcium metal filings are mixed to- 
gether in a closed-end iron tube in stoichiometrical propor- 
tions (3.7 g KC1 to 1 g Ca). This iron tube is introduced 
into the thickened end of a hard-glass tube as shown in 
Fig. 1. The glass is thickened in order to allow the attain- 
ment of the maximum temperature; at lower temperatures 
where a thinner glass wall would collapse the reaction pro-

ceeds very slowly. After the iron tube is introduced, the 
hard-glass tube is closed by fusing the glass with the hand 
torch. After a good vacuum is attained, the chemicals are 
heated, slowly at first and finally strongly until the reaction 
is complete. The chemicals may be heated until the glass 
starts to soften, but too much heat should be avoided, since 
it will distill calcium metal. The reduced and once-distilled 
metal condenses in the bend of the tube as shown in Fig. 1. 
From there, it is worked down with the flame into the 
receiving ampoule, where it is sealed off as illustrated.

ampoule 




Fig. 1. 

The alkali metals react vigorously with air, and the 
ampoule should be opened without exposing the metal to 
air. This is done by the following procedures : The ampoule 
is constructed of Pyrex glass with an annular tungsten ring 
to spring the glass. After the ampoule is mounted in the 
vacuum system, the tungsten ring is heated with a high- 
frequency induction coil until the glass breaks. (See Fig. 2.) 

A scheme which does not involve the use of high-frequency 
heating but which breaks the glass by impact is illustrated by 
Fig. 3. The illustrated depression in the tube wall acts as 
a safety to confine the armature and prevent accidental

fracture of the ampoule until the apparatus is sealed onto 
the high-vacuum system. During this sealing operation the 
depression is blown out of the 
way of the armature. The 
armature is operated in the 
vacuum, by means of an ex- 
ternal electromagnet, to break 
the tip of the ampoule, thus 
exposing the alkali metal.

or benzene to free it from kerosene. The petroleum ether or 
benzene is dried by shaking it in contact with calcium chlo- 
ride. (Carbon tetrachloride or chloroform should not be used 
to wash the metal, since an explosive compound is formed.) 
The metal is then fused in the bottom of an 8-mm glass tube 
and sucked up into a 1-mm capillary glass tube with a rubber 
hose. This 1-mm tube is sealed off with a flame just above 
the metal. At the other end the alkali is protected from

A distillation procedure 2 for sodium metal is illustrated in 
Fig. 5 whereby the metal is refluxed under vacuum to free 
it of hydrogen and carbohydrates (the hydrogen contained 
in potassium or sodium, measured as a gas at atmospheric 
pressure, may amount to one or two hundred times the 
volume of the metal). The metal cubes are washed to free 
them of kerosene, as described above, and then they are in- 
troduced into Chamber I. After the whole system is evac- 
uated, the metal is fused in this chamber. Chamber I acts 
as a separating funnel. The fusion is accomplished by the

Chamber II, leaving the dross behind. Chamber I is then

hours. The distilled metal condenses in the asbestos-insu- 
lated tube above Chamber II. This refluxing allows hydro- 
gen and hydrocarbon vapors to be pumped away. After 
this treatment the metal is distilled into Chamber III by a 
heater wire around the condenser tube. Chamber II is then 
removed at the seal-off. Chamber III may be the receiver 
for the metal, or it may be further refluxed and distilled into 
a final receiving ampoule. Electric heat is recommended for

distilling the alkali metal, since there is some danger of 
breaking the glass if it is heated with a torch. 

In manipulating the alkali metals the following precau- 
tions should be observed : The amount of metal manipulated 
should never be greater than necessary. A box of sand 
should be at hand for the control of accidental fires. The 
alkali metals should never be allowed to come in contact 
with water. Used metal and apparatus containing the alkali

metals should be disposed of by burying only. It is advis- 
able to wear goggles to protect the eyes while manipulating 
the alkali metals. 

Sodium may be prepared by electrolysis through the soda- 
glass walls of an electric lamp. A 32-volt lamp, which has a 
larger tungsten filament wire than the 110- volt lamp, is best 
for this purpose. The lamp bulb is first evacuated by means 
of a side tube sealed on for this purpose. It is then dipped 
in a bath of fused sodium nitrate and nitrite and connected 
to a source of electrical energy as shown in Fig. 6. Current is 
carried from the tungsten filament to the glass walls of the 
lamp bulb by electrons or by means of a sodium discharge, 
or in special cases by means of an argon discharge. The 



Chap. XIII] MATERIALS OF RESEARCH 



537 



practical details of this procedure are due to Dr. R. C. Burt, 
who graphically described the procedure as one which allows 
the vacuum to be electroplated with sodium. 3 The free 
metal is formed from the reduced sodium ions (which migrate 
through the solid glass electrolyte when a current flows). 
These ions are reduced by electrons, or negative sodium 
(or argon) ions. Faraday's law applies to the electrolysis. 
The spectrum of the sodium vapor discharge has been photo- 
graphed and the spectrum indicates high purity of the 
electrolyzed metal. Impurities were estimated by Dr. Burt 
as being present, at most, in the proportion of 2 parts per 




Fluoresence of sodium vapor. 



million. Sodium prepared by electrolysis is characterized 
by the fact that it is completely free of hydrogen and carbo- 
hydrates. 

The electrolysis current varies from a few milliamperes 
when the current is carried entirely by electrons to a few 
hundred milliamperes when it is carried by sodium ions. The 
sodium discharge is obtained by simply removing the air 
blast on the lamp bulb which normally serves to keep the 
metal condensed. 

Burt states that the spectrum from the sodium discharge 
is not reversed; a warmed lamp containing sodium will

fluoresce if the light of the sodium discharge from another 
lamp is focused on it. (See Fig. 7.) 

Sodium may be introduced into quartz photocells by 
means of a graded seal as shown in Fig. 8. 

Potassium can be electrolyzed through a potassium glass 
which is free of sodium and lead. A bath of fused potassium 
nitrite and nitrate is used. 

The alkali metals potassium and sodium may be dissolved 
in the volatile solvent, liquid ammonia, and deposited where

they are desired by boiling away this solvent. Lithium is 
managed in a similar manner with aethylamine as solvent. 

All the alkali metals react with glass at elevated tempera- 
tures and especially with lead glass, with which they should 
not be allowed to come in contact. 

The resistance of Pyrex-glass tubes toward sodium can be 
improved if they are lined with a film of borax or boracic 
acid. The tube to be lined is filled with a hot saturated 
solution of borax. The borax precipitates from this solution 



Chap. XIII] MATERIALS OF RESEARCH 539 

as crystals on the inner glass walls of the tube as the solution 
cools. When the glass has become lined with a thin coating 
of crystals, the solution is drawn off and the tube carefully 
dried. It is then evacuated, and the water is driven off by 
heating. At first the heating is gentle, but finally the tube 
is fired at the maximum temperature the glass will stand. 
This gives the tube a smooth sodium resistant inner surface. 

The potassium-sodium alloys, lying within the composi- 
tion range 45 to 90 per cent potassium, are liquid at room 
temperature. 

Alkali-earth metals. The chief uses of the alkali-earth 
metals, as getters, depend on their reactions with oxygen to 
form oxides, with carbon dioxide to form carbides and 
oxides, with water to form hydrides and oxides, and with 
nitrogen to form nitrides. 

When fresh calcium filings are heated in a quartz tube or 
heavy-walled Pyrex side tube, connected to an apparatus 
such as a thermopile, the calcium reacts with all the residual 
gases (except the noble gases) . A fairly good vacuum can be 
obtained with such a side tube even when starting at atmos- 
pheric pressure. For example, the argon spectrum may be 
obtained in a discharge tube evacuated from atmospheric 
pressure once or twice with such a calcium side tube. Each 
time the tube is evacuated from atmospheric pressure with 
calcium, the residual pressure of argon (calculated from its 
abundance in the atmosphere) is increased by an amount 
7 X 1CT 2 mm. 

Barium is a more reactive metal than calcium. 4 It is used 
as a getter for commercial radio tubes. For this applica- 
tion, the metal is sometimes cast in a seamless tube of nickel 
or copper which is drawn down to wire. These composite 
wires are known as Niba and Cuba wires. The wires are cut 
into short lengths, which are introduced into radio tubes and 
other places where the getter action is desired. The volatile

York City.

core metal is subsequently boiled out of the nickel or copper 
covering tube by means of heat generated with a high- 
frequency induction coil. 

Mercury. Although mercury approaches the noble metals 
in chemical inertness, it is easily contaminated, especially by 
other metals. This is because, as a liquid, it is a fairly good 
solvent. A simple test for the purity of a sample of mercury

is to raise a clean glass rod slowly up through the metal 
surface. If the mercury is clean, the glass will come up 
without any adhering mercury droplets. 

The contaminations commonly found in mercury may be 
classified according to the manner in which they can be easily 
removed. First come surface contaminations by materials 
which do not dissolve in the liquid metal and may, accord- 
ingly, be removed by filtering the metal through pinholes in 
filter paper or through a chamois skin. Second, there are the 
dissolved metals. Those which are oxidizable are first con-

verted to insoluble oxides by the blowing of air through the 
mercury as shown in Fig. 9(a). The oxides form a scum on 
the mercury surface and may later be filtered off. Mercury 
is practically free of impurities of this type if, after air has 
been blown through the liquid metal | hour, no scum has 
formed on the surface. The alkali metals fall into this class 
of impurities; here also belong zinc, with a high vapor 
pressure, and copper and lead, with low vapor pressures. 
These metals, which are more reactive than mercury, can also 
be removed by exposing the mercury to a solution of 10 per 
cent HN0 3 or 80 per cent H 2 S0 4 . This is shown in Fig. 9 (b) . 
Thirdly, there are the dissolved metals, such as the noble 
metals and tin, which cannot be removed by oxidation or 
acid. Copper and lead may also be considered as belonging 
to this class of contaminations. These metals are removed 
by vacuum distillation of the mercury at a temperature of 
about 180° to 200°C. (at which temperature the mercury 
distills at the rate of approximately § g/cm 2 /sec.) as indi- 
cated by Fig. 9(c). 

The vapor pressure of mercury is given in Table I. It 
is to be noted thoughtfully that at room temperature the

vapor density of mercury is many times greater than the 
accepted nonpoisonous concentration limit, which is 1 milli- 
gram of mercury per cubic meter. According to Stock, 
continual breathing of air containing only 15 micrograms 
per cubic meter of mercury for a few weeks will make most

persons ill. 6 The vapor pressure of mercury is hazardously 
high in many laboratories. In a Berlin physical laboratory 
the typical concentration of mercury vapor in the air was 
found to be about 20 to 60 micrograms per cubic meter; in 
one room it was 500 micrograms per cubic meter. Heat 
produoed by turning on mercury pumps doubled the concen- 
tration of mercury vapor in the air. 6 

Platinum metals. Platinum is chemically resistant to 
alkalies and hydrofluoric acid. However, it is attacked by 
chlorine vapor and aqua regia. Metallic salts should not be 
heated in platinum under conditions which may result in the 
reduction of the metal and the consequent debasement and 
embrittlement of the platinum. This applies particularly to 
lead salts. The elements phosphorus and silicon also attack 
platinum and make it brittle, and they may change its other 
properties. For example, even the small amount of silicon 
introduced into the platinum when it is heated in contact 
with porcelain in a reducing atmosphere makes an appre- 
ciable change in the thermoelectric power and electrical 
resistance. 

Platinum is so ductile that wires may be drawn directly as 
fine as 20ju diameter. By Wollaston's procedure a platinum 
rod is covered with a close-fitting silver tube, and this com- 
posite rod is drawn through wire dies. After the silver has 
been etched off the final wire with nitric acid, the platinum 
wire obtained may be as small as |^i in diameter. Wollaston 
wire is often used for fuses to protect delicate instruments. 7 

A physical property of platinum which is of interest to 
the physicist is its "transparency" to hydrogen gas at tem- 
peratures above 700°C. (See Fig. 10.) This property is 
employed to obtain very pure hydrogen.

Platinum is a refractory metal. For this reason it may be 
used for furnace windings and as a base for oxide cathodes. 

Iridium is harder and more resistant to chemical attack 
than platinum; it is not attacked by aqua regia. Accord- 
ingly, it is often alloyed with platinum in proportions up to 
30 per cent to yield a metal which is superior to platinum in 
respect to chemical resistance and hardness. 

Rhodium is alloyed with platinum (90 Pt to 10 Rh) to 
yield the LeChatelier thermocouple alloy. Rhodium is a 
bright inert metal and for this reason it is used for electro- 
plating other metals. 

Osmium is the most refractory metal of the platinum 
family, with a melting temperature of 2700°C. It was once

used in incandescent lamps but has now been replaced by 
tungsten for this use. Incidentally, it is the heaviest known 
substance, having a density of 22.5 g/cm 3 . 

Palladium is the least noble of the platinum metals. It 
oxidizes when heated in air and is dissolved in nitric acid. 
Hydrogen diffuses through palladium more rapidly than 
through platinum. At atmospheric pressure palladium will 
dissolve about 6 mg H 2 per 100 g of metal to form the "alloy" 
Pd 2 H. The hydrogen is given off again if the metal is heated,

This property affords a convenient source of extremely 
pure hydrogen in small quantities. 

The refractory metals : Tungsten, molybdenum, tantalum, 
and so forth. Tungsten is the most refractory metal and 
also the strongest. Wires of .0014 inch in diameter exhibit 
a tensile strength of 590,000 lbs./square inch. Tungsten is 

quite "unorthodox" in its 
behavior with respect to cold 
working and heat. Passing 
it through dies makes it more 
ductile, while heating it to 
a temperature greater than 
1000 C C. causes recrystalliza- 
tion and makes it brittle, a 
situation just opposite to the 
behavior of most metals. 
The ductility of tungsten at 
ordinary temperatures is due 
to its long fibrous crystal 
grains. Fig. 11 shows the 
ductility of tungsten at vari- 
ous temperatures. It will be 
noted that recrystallized brittle tungsten is ductile if heated 
to temperatures greater than 200°C. 

Traces of water vapor are corrosive on the tungsten fila- 
ments in vacuum electric lamps. The water molecule reacts 
with hot tungsten to form tungsten oxide and atomic hydro- 
gen, both of which evaporate to the glass wall of the bulb, 
where, owing to catalytic effect of the glass, they react to give 
metallic tungsten and water vapor again. The water molecule 
is now free again to repeat its action on the tungsten filament. 
Tungsten reacts with oxygen and carbon monoxide, in 
vacuum, to form oxides and carbides. Tungsten is not 
attacked or affected by mercury vapor or hydrogen gas. In 
air, at a yellow heat, tungsten reacts with oxygen to form 
volatile oxides, which distill off as white smoke.

Chap. XIII] MATERIALS OF RESEARCH 545 

Molybdenum is more ductile than tungsten. Otherwise, 
it is very similar to tungsten, and the two metals form alloys 
in all proportions. Some of these alloys are used com- 
mercially. Their properties are, in general, a compromise 
between the higher melting temperature of tungsten, on the 
one hand, and the greater workability and machinability of 
molybdenum, on the other. 

Molybdenum and tungsten do not soft-solder or amal- 
gamate with mercury, but both metals may be welded to 
nickel or Advance alloy. Nickel is frequently welded to 
tungsten to facilitate connecting it by spot-welding, solder- 
ing, or brazing to other less refractory metals. 

Tungsten or molybdenum may be cleaned by heating the 
metal to a red heat and rubbing its surface with a piece of 
potassium or sodium nitrite. 

In many respects tantalum is like molybdenum and 
tungsten. 8 Tantalum, when it is very pure, is one of the 
most ductile metals. However, when heated in hydrogen or 
air, tantalum becomes brittle. To anneal tantalum, it must 
be heated to about 800°C. in a vacuum better than 5 X 
10 -2 mm of mercury. Because tantalum readily gives off 
occluded gas if heated above 800°C, it is used as a construc- 
tion material in vacuum tubes. 

To spot-weld this metal successfully, it must be submerged 
under carbon tetrachloride or water. It may be machined 
using carbon tetrachloride as a cutting fluid, and spun using 
hard laundry soap as lubricant. 

Columbium occurs with tantalum and has many proper- 
ties in common with it. It is less refractory and more ductile 
than tantalum. It is used as a substitute for tantalum. 

Rhenium is the heaviest member of the manganese sub- 
group in the periodic table, and it is very refractory, its 
melting temperature being only about 200° below that of 
tungsten. 



8 Tungsten, molybdenum, and tantalum may be obtained from the Fan- 
steel Products Company, Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, and Callite Products 
Company, 595 Forty-Ninth Street, Union City, New Jersey.

Alloys. Invar. The iron-nickel alloy, 63.5 Fe, 36 Ni, 
0.5 Mn, is known as Invar. Its coefficient of expansion is 
only low for temperatures below 120°C, being 4 X 10 -7 per 
degree centigrade. The heat conduction of Invar is also 
very low, being only fa that of copper. Invar does not 
corrode. It is used for the construction of surveyor's tapes 
and instruments in which the dimensions are required to 
remain constant in spite of temperature changes. The alloy 
melts at 1425 °C. 

Electrical-resistance alloys} Nickel-chromium alloys are 
characterized by a high electrical resistance (about 58 times 
that of copper), a low temperature coefficient of resistance, 
and a high resistance to oxidation. Examples are Chromel

A and Nichrome V, of which the typical composition is 
80 Ni and 20 Cr, with the melting point at 1420°C. 

When some iron is added to the nickel-chromium alloys, 
it makes them more ductile. Nichrome and Chromel C are 
examples of these iron-containing alloys. The typical com- 
position of Nichrome is 60 Ni, 12 Cr, 26 Fe, 2 Mn, and of 
Chromel C, 64 Ni, 11 Cr, 25 Fe. The melting temperatures 
of these alloys are 1350° and 1390°C. respectively. The 
change of resistance with temperature for these alloys is 
illustrated in Fig. 12. 

Thermocouple alloys. Chromel P gives a useful base- 
metal thermocouple in combination with the alloy Alumel 
(94 Ni, 1\ Mn, \ Fe). The thermocouple wires are welded 
together under a borax flux to make the junction. None of 
the Chromels braze, but they all may be welded to nickel. 

Constantan (45 Ni, 55 Cu) has practically zero tempera- 
ture coefficient of resistance up to a temperature of 400°C. 
Also, it gives a high thermal e.m.f . against copper, making an 
excellent thermocouple. Constantan exhibits high resist- 
ance to oxidation and corrosion. It solders easily. 

Solders. Solders are required to flow onto the surface of 
the metals to be joined and to alloy with the surface layers of 
the metals. Also, they should be ductile, have high strength, 
and be noncorrosive. 

Silver solder best meets all these requirements. It is used 
for joining brass, steel, stainless steels, and many other 
metals. Silver solders are, in effect, brazing alloys of the 
composition (4 Cu to 3 Zn) with silver added. A solder 
melting at 693 °C. contains 65 per cent silver, while one 
melting at 760°C. contains but 20 per cent silver. 

High-quality soft solder is half tin and half lead. Solders 
are often made with a higher content of lead, since the tin 
component is more expensive than lead. Such solders are 
inferior, since it is the tin component that makes the solder 
run well and adhere well. "Half-and-half" solder melts at 
188°C. The properties of various solders are given in 
Table II.

point than borax. 



Brass and bronze. Brass is the most widely used con- 
struction material in the physical laboratory. It is funda- 
mentally a copper-zinc alloy. Red brass (10 to 20 per cent 
zinc), or so-called Tombak alloy, is used for making flexible 
corrugated tubes (such as Silphon tubes) when maximum 
ductility is required; yellow or common brass, which con- 
tains copper and zinc in the proportions 65 to 35, with small 
lead additions to increase its machinability, is used where 
springiness is desired. 

Brasses are less expensive than the copper-tin alloys or 
bronzes. They are also softer and more ductile. Brasses 
are used for drawing and rolling, whereas bronzes are prima- 
rily casting materials. Bronze castings are much more likely 
to be vacuum tight than brass castings. Also, because 
bronzes have small crystals of the hard brittle compound 
Cu 4 Sn, they make good bearing metals (the 68.2 copper 



Chap. XIII] MATERIALS OF RESEARCH 549 

bronze, Cu 4 Sn, is the true speculum metal used for optical 
gratings and for mirrors). 10 

Duraluminum. The aluminum alloy with composition 
95 Al, 4 Cu, | Mg, £ Mn, is known as Duraluminum. Dura- 
luminum is employed extensively in many cases where brass 
was formerly used. For about 45 minutes after it has been 
heat treated at 530°C. and quenched in water, Duraluminum 
is ductile and can be rolled, bent, or cold-worked. After 
this interval a copper aluminum compound is precipitated 
out of solid solution, and this precipitate "keys" the crystals 
of the alloy at their slip planes, giving the alloy increased 
hardness and strength. The tensile strength, originally 
30,000 lbs. /square inch after quenching, becomes as great as 
75,000 lbs. /square inch after cold-working and aging. Dura- 
luminum rivets are frequently stored in buckets cooled with 
dry ice. They may be used as desired, for this low tempera- 
ture arrests the aging process, and the metal does not harden 
until after it has warmed up to room temperature. 

Wood. 11 Two kinds of wood are obtained from a tree: 
heartwood and sapwood. The heartwood is formed early in 
the life of the tree and, as the name implies, is found near the 
center of the trunk. Protoplasms present when the tree is 
young are gradually replaced by deposits of gum, minerals, 
tannin, and pigments to form this heartwood as the tree 
becomes older. These substances make it heavier, stronger, 
and in most cases darker than the sapwood. The heartwood 
of the redwood tree, which is particularly free from gums and 
oils, is an exception. In other heartwoods there are abun-

dant deposits. For example, in lignum vitae, these com- 
pounds produce an oiliness (especially when the wood is wet) 
which makes it suitable as a bearing material. 

Sapwood, or the outer part of the tree, is more pliable than 
heartwood. Therefore, in using such woods as hickory and 
ash, which are noted for their adequate strength, the outer 
part of the trunk may be preferred to the heartwood be- 
cause of its pliability. 

Effects of temperature. Some of the effects of temperature 
on wood are due to the gum deposits. High temperature 
softens these gums, making the wood weaker and more liable 
to split. On the other hand, low temperatures produce in- 
creased brittleness. 

The thermal expansion of wood in directions parallel and 
perpendicular to the grain is given in Table III. It will be 
noted that the expansion parallel to the grain is less for wood 
than for most of the metals. This property is a useful one, 
and it should be kept in mind and used in the construction of 
instruments where invariance of length is desired, as, for 
example, in a telescope tube, in which the relative distance 
between the optical components should not change with 
changes in temperature.

The heat conductivity of several common types of wood 
is given in Table IV. The conduction of heat is from two to 
four times as great along the grain as it is across it. The 
conductivity depends, in a large measure, on the moisture 
content. To obtain maximum heat insulation, the wood 
must be dry. To keep it dry, particularly if the wood is to 
be exposed to low temperatures, it should be coated with 
paraffin.

Effects of moisture. One drawback to the use of wood as a 
material for construction, especially for scientific apparatus, 
lies in the fact that its dimensions may change considerably 
with its change in moisture content. We may take the 
shrinkage from the green to the dry condition as an index of 
the changes one may expect with changes in humidity and 
residual curing. This shrinkage (radial and tangential) for 
several woods is given in Table V.

552 MATERIALS OF RESEARCH [Chap. XIII 

Among the hardwoods, evergreen magnolia is prized as 
one which does not warp. This may be understood by re- 
ferring to Table V, where we see that of all the woods it is the 
one whose radial and tangential shrinkages are most nearly 
equal. 

Most of the shrinkage in wood is at right angles to the 
grain; the longitudinal shrinkage, taken from the green to 
the cured condition, is seldom greater than iV to | per cent. 
(It is greater than this for some woods, particularly woods 
grown under strong compression. Yellow pine compression 
wood, for example, may shrink longitudinally as much as 
2| per cent when it is cured. Redwoods also exhibit con- 
siderable longitudinal shrinkage. However, longitudinal 
shrinkage is negligible for most of the other woods.) This 
property of wood, in addition to the low thermal expansion 
parallel to the grain, explains why wood has been used so 
successfully for rulers; it may suggest other applications for 
wood in the laboratory. 

When a piece of wood is carved or cut to precise dimen- 
sions that are to be maintained, it should be painted at once 
with several coats of shellac, in order to maintain the mois- 
ture equilibrium already established. Linseed oil is less 
effective, while paraffin is more effective than shellac for this 
purpose. Molten paraffin is applied by pouring it over the 
surface with a spoon. The boiling of wood in paraffin 
causes it to become brittle. 

Strength of wood. Strength and rigidity do not vary from 
wood to wood as much as is commonly supposed. For ex- 
ample, the bending strength of shagbark hickory is only 
2.6 times as great as that of sugar pine, and pine is inferior 
to hickory in rigidity by a factor of only 1.9. Pine differs 
from hickory not so much in stiffness as in brittleness — 
pine breaks where hickory bends. Spruce, of all the com- 
mon woods, has the highest strength for its weight. 

The tensile strength of wood varies in different directions. 
Along the grain its strength is ordinarily from ten to twenty 
times as great as it is across the grain. Also, the modulus of

elasticity is correspondingly greater along the grain. This 
anisotropy is avoided in plywoods, formed by gluing together 
three, five, seven, or nine layers of wood, the consecutive 
layers being arranged with their grain axes lying mutually 
perpendicular. Plywoods with the greatest number of 
layers are most resistant to splitting and are most nearly 
isotropic. The thick plywoods use cores of wormy chestnut. 
The ease with which woods are cut and carved is proportional 



554 MATERIALS OF RESEARCH [Chap. XIII 

to their homogeneity or the degree of similarity between the 
physical properties of the spring and the summer growth. 
Also, it is desirable to have a fine grain, a quality possessed 
by many hardwoods, especially mahogany. Of the common 
softwoods, poplar and sugar pine are the most homogeneous 
and easiest to work. 

Some wood substitutes are now available which are nearly 
isotropic. These are formed of bonded cellulose fibers. 
Although they are quite homogeneous, they are not so easily 
worked as wood with the plane and chisel, and nailing splits 
them. They can be sawed with the ordinary wood saw. 
Masonite is an example of such a wood substitute. 12 It 
comes, chiefly, in three grades, a light material which is a 
good heat insulator, a harder material which is suitable for 
making boxes for instruments, and an oil-tempered water- 
proof material. 

Waxes and cements. The physicist uses waxes and 
cements to seal windows into apparatus, tubes in plates, 
tubes together, and so forth. He uses them also to support 
and fasten down lenses, prisms, and mirrors. Of all waxes 
available, the most useful for making improvised supports 
and seals is the so-called universal wax. 

Universal wax. Universal wax is made from 1 part 
Venetian turpentine and 5 parts beeswax. It is usually, 
although not necessarily, colored with vermilion. It should 
be made up in small quantities, for it oxidizes, with the result 
that it becomes hard and loses its desirable properties. Old 
pieces may be useful if the outside oxidized layers are re- 
moved and discarded. The usefulness of this wax depends 
upon its adhesive and plastic properties. It is quite plastic 
at the slightly elevated temperature attained when the wax 
is worked between the fingers. When it cools, it becomes 
fairly rigid. 

Beeswax and rosin. Beeswax and rosin compound is pre- 
pared by melting together equal parts of beeswax and rosin. 
Its softening point is at the temperature which just begins to

Chap. XIII] MATERIALS OF RESEARCH 555 

feel hot (47°C.) and it is liquid at 10° above this temperature. 
Its outstanding property is its adhesiveness to cold metal. 
It is not very strong, but its strength is adequate for sealing 
vacuum systems and for fixing apparatus, as, for example, 
fastening a prism to the prism table of a spectrometer. It 
can be applied with a brush, an eye-dropper, or the blade of 
a knife. To secure the best bond to cold metal, the wax 
should be applied smoking hot with an eye-dropper or a 
knife. When it has been used for sealing down a bell jar, 
it can be removed with a putty knife, remelted, and used 
over and over. The smoking temperature distills off some 
of the beeswax, causing the compound to become harder. It 
may be retempered by adding more beeswax. There are 
many applications for which this wax is not suitable because 
it shrinks a great deal on solidifying. It is best "dissolved" 
by a mixture of equal parts of carbon tetrachloride and ethyl 
alcohol. 

Shellac. In its pure state, shellac in stick form is known as 
lapidarist's cement. It has a high tensile strength and shear 
strength. (Both are about 3800 lbs. /square inch.) Only 
the natural orange shellac possesses this high strength. The 
main ingredient of the better grades of sealing wax and 
especially banker's wax is shellac. 

Shellac is used in commerce chiefly for the manufacture of 
phonograph records, varnishes, and as an insulator in the 
electrical industry. It has a higher resilience than almost 
any other wax, and it is this property which gives long life to 
phonograph records. 

The best solvent for shellac is alcohol. This solution 
yields a varnish which has many uses in the laboratory. 
When it is very thick, it is useful for hunting leaks in vacuum 
systems. 

Shellac is polymerized by heat, giving a product which is 
harder, has a higher softening temperature, and is less soluble 
in alcohol than the uncured material. This polymerization 
is accompanied by a chemical loss of water and a two- to 
threefold increase in molecular weight. Half of the uncured 



556 MATERIALS OF RESEARCH [Chap. XIII 

shellac is transformed into this harder variety by heating for 
30 hours at 90°C. ; at 150°C. it is completely transformed in 
3 hours. When the pure shellac is to be used as a cement, it 
is desirable to have it in the unpolymerized state. 

Commercial shellac may legally be designated as pure 
although it may contain as much as 3 per cent rosin. This 
materially weakens it. It is possible, however, to obtain 
shellac which is free from this adulterant. 13 

Tempered shellac. When shellac is tempered with 20 to 
40 per cent wood tar, we have a wax similar to the familiar 
DeKhotinsky cement. This wax is not affected by water, 
carbon disulphide, benzol, petroleum benzine, or turpentine. 
It is affected only slightly by ether, chloroform, and sul- 
phuric, nitric, or hydrochloric acids. 

When DeKhotinsky cement is heated in a flame, it emits 
an odor and is somewhat inflammable. A new variety of 
tempered shellac, which has no odor and is not so inflam- 
mable, is now sold by the Central Scientific Company under 
the trade name of Sealstix. Sealstix has a greater working 
range of temperature than pure shellac and a very high 
strength. 

Shellac can be tempered with butyl phthalate. The re- 
sulting compound has a very low vapor pressure and is 
particularly suitable for high-vacuum work. It is odorless 
and relatively noninflammable. 

Shellac can also be tempered to varying degrees with oil of 
cassia. About 10 per cent oil is quickly added to the molten 
shellac. The oil gives a compound with an agreeable odor. 
It is useful for many purposes when its vapor pressure is not 
important. 

Shellac can also be tempered with amyl acetate for use 
when the vapor pressure of this constituent is unobjection- 
able. Most of this solvent evaporates when the cemented 
elements are maintained at an elevated temperature (80°C.) 
for an hour or so. A mixture of 2 ounces of amyl acetate to

516 West 49th Street, New York City. 



Chap. XIII] MATERIALS OF RESEARCH 557 

100 g of shellac gives a cement with a strength in excess of 
2500 lbs./square inch. 14 

Picein. This sealing compound is characterized by low 
vapor pressure, plasticity at room temperature, and chemical 
inertness. Its low working temperature (it becomes quite 
plastic at 50°C. and is liquid at 80°C), together with its 
adhesiveness, recommends it for many applications. Be- 
sides its use for sealing tubes together and repairing leaks in 
vacuum systems, it is also used in the optical industry. It is 
practically unaffected by alcohol. Picein is immune even to 
a short immersion in cold dichromate cleaning solution. It 
is dissolved by benzol and turpentine. Its insulating quali- 
ties are said to be as good as amber if it is not overheated. 
It comes in two grades, the second being characterized by a 
liquefying temperature of 105 °C. 15 

Apiezon compounds. 16 Apiezon compounds are especially 
refined residues of paraffin oils freed from high vapor pressure 
constituents. 

The sealing compound "Q" contains graphite. It is 
plastic at ordinary temperatures and has a vapor pressure of 
10 -4 mm at room temperature, and, applied to ordinary 
twine, it is recommended as a packing for vacuum valves. 

Apiezon wax "W" has the lowest vapor pressure of any of 
the waxes now available. It is necessary to heat this wax to 
180°C. in order to raise its vapor pressure to 10~ 3 mm of 
mercury. It melts at 70°C, but it can best be applied at 
100°C. or higher. Molten, it wets metals and glass and is 
quite fluid. It is fairly strong at ordinary temperatures. 
It is soluble in zylene. 

Silver chloride. Silver chloride is recommended for seals 
that must hold at elevated temperatures. It melts at 455 °C. 
It is insoluble in water, alcohol, benzol, and acid. It is,

from the distributing agents of the New York Hamburg Rubber Company,

however, soluble in a solution of sodium thiosulphate. Most 
metals and glasses are wet by fused silver chloride. It is 
useful for sealing optically worked windows on a discharge 
tube. The window, after being sealed, is cooled slowly to 
prevent it from cracking. 

Espe and Knoll describe an enamel which they recommend 
for cementing optical plane parallels on a discharge tube. 17 
This is a mixture of clay and boracic acid, the melting point 
of which is 450° to 600°C. It is applied, as is silver chloride, 
by heating both the window and discharge tube in an 
electric oven. 

The bonding materials which we have considered above 
are thermoplastics. With the exception of shellac, the 
changes in their properties are reversible with temperature. 
We will now treat those substances which set, which can be 
vulcanized, and which polymerize by the application of heat. 
They include the synthetic resins, rubber cements, and 
inorganic cements. 

Synthetic resins treated of here fall into three broad 
divisions. These are, first, the polymerized phenol alde- 
hydes, of which Bakelite is an example; second, the con- 
densation products formed by polyhydric alcohols with poly- 
basic acids (these are termed alkyd resins, of which Glyptal 
is an example); and third, the polymerized derivatives of 
methacrylic acid, of which Lucite and Plexiglas are examples. 

Bakelite. 18 Bakelite comes in several forms that are useful 
to the physicist. The properties of these vary from liquid 
or soluble solids in the uncured condition to stable insoluble 
solids in the cured condition. Bakelite in the latter con- 
dition is obtainable in the form of clear, transparent sheets, 
blocks, tubes, and so forth. This material is light (density, 
1.27) and strong (7000 lbs. /square inch), is a good electrical 
insulator, and is insensitive to moderate heat. In this com- 
pletely polymerized form it does not melt, and it chars only

18 Bakelite is manufactured by the Bakelite Corporation of America, 
247 Park Avenue, New York City. 



Chap. XIII] MATERIALS OF RESEARCH 559 

at a temperature of 285 °C. Chemically, it is relatively inert. 
The completely polymerized Bakelite is unaffected by hot 
water, oils, greases, alcohol, acetone, benzene, dilute mineral 
acids, including hydrofluoric, and soap. It is practically 
nonhygroscopic. These properties recommend it as a 
material for making transparent chemical apparatus, such as 
burettes, pipettes, beakers, and so forth. Transparent 
forms of Bakelite are suitable for making models for photo- 
elastic studies with polarized light. 

Several molded and laminated products bonded with 
Bakelite are available commercially. These have canvas, 
wood fiber, asbestos, or graphite as a base. The asbestos- 
base material is especially heat resistant, and the graphite- 
base material is useful for dry bearings. 

Bakelite varnishes usually consist of solutions of the 
unpolymerized form. After application and drying, the 
varnish films are transformed to the insoluble form by 
baking. 

Bakelite cements come in the form of solids and viscous 
liquids. The solid form melts at about 80 °C. (in hot water) 
and is transformed by heat to a form which does not melt. 
The liquid forms contain a volatile solvent. It is first 
necessary to evaporate this by preliminary heating of 1 to 
4 hours at 80°C, after which the residue is polymerized by 
heating for 2 hours at 120 °C. A self -hardening cement is 
available which will set at room temperature. Vacuum seals 
made with these cements have a low vapor pressure and can 
be used to temperatures slightly above 100°C. 

A general-utility cement can be made by mixing Bakelite 
varnish with red lead. This hardens rapidly and will with- 
stand high pressure, steam, oil, and moderate heating. 

Alkyd resins. 19 Alkyd resins are formed by the conden- 
sation of phthalic anhydride on glycol, glycerol, or other 
polyhydric alcohols. Glycol phthalate is useful as a 
vacuum-sealing cement because of its low vapor pressure, 
fluidity, and wetting power when melted. In addition, it 

19 Alkyd resins may be obtained from the General Electric Company. 



560 MATERIALS OF RESEARCH [Chap. XIII 

may be cured to give it increased strength and inertness. It 
is also noted for its adhesiveness to aluminum. It is inert 
toward mineral oils. Dehydrating catalysts, such as zinc 
oxide, hasten the cure of these compounds and serve as a 
filler to economize on the resin, as, for example, in lamp- 
basing cements. 

Lucite and Plexiglas. Lucite and Plexiglas are trade 
names for methyl (and ethyl) methacrylate, polymerized 
derivatives of methacrylic acid. 20 These materials are sold 
as a cast resin in the form of sheets, rods, and tubes, as a 
thermoplastic powder, and as the unpolymerized liquid. 

The methyl methacrylate monomer is a mobile liquid 
which can be polymerized in almost any desired form. The 
monomer boils at 100°C. and has a heat of polymerization of 
about 80 calories/g. As it is obtained from the factory, it 
contains an inhibitor, such as hydroquinone or pyrogallol, to 
prevent it from polymerizing at room temperature. To use 
the liquid, this inhibitor is removed by washing with caustic, 
the liquid is dried, and an accelerator, usually benzoyl 
peroxide, is added to catalyze the polymerization. The 
volume of the monomer is 20 per cent greater than the 
volume of the polymer finally obtained, so that considerable 
art must be invoked to prevent the formation of voids when 
the monomer condenses. 

The polymerized methyl methacrylate, Lucite, has the 
optical properties given in Table VII. (See also Table VI, 
Chapter IX.) The polymers are inert toward water and in- 
soluble in the straight chain hydrocarbons, alcohols, and 
ethers and in most fats, oils, and waxes. They are, however, 
dissolved by lower ketone and ester solvents, and by mix- 
tures of the aromatic hydrocarbons when small amounts of 
alcohol are added. 

These polymers are vastly different from Bakelite and the 
plastic, Catalin, in respect to cutting. Whereas Catalin and 



20 Lucite is manufactured by E. I. duPont de Nemours and Company, 
Wilmington, Delaware. Plexiglas is manufactured by Rohm and Haas 
Company, 222 West Washington Square, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Bakelite quickly remove the edge from high-speed steel (in 
fact, cold-rolled steel is just about as good for cutting them 
as high-speed steel), Lucite and Plexiglas can be cut by the 
hour without the edge of the tool becoming dulled. 

Fish-glue cement. A cement which is inert toward most 
organic solvents is made from a thick solution of 3 ounces of 
fish glue, | ounce of potassium bichromate, and a little am- 
monia. The cement so formed is allowed to dry and is then 
heated in an air oven until it assumes a chocolate-brown 
color. This cement is often used on Pulfrich refractometers. 

Rubber cements. Rubber cements are conveniently classi- 
fied as follows: nonvulcanizing cements, which attain their 
strength simply by the evaporation of a solvent; vulcanizing 
cements, in which a chemical change occurs after the evapo- 
ration of the solvent; and thermoplastic cements. Some of 
the vulcanizing cements contain sulphur, while others are 
vulcanized simply by painting a vulcanizing liquid, sulphur 
chloride, on the rubber after it has been applied. 

The synthetic thermoplastic rubber-like products Neo- 
prene (manufactured by DuPont Company) and Koroseal 
(manufactured by the Goodrich Rubber Company) have 
many useful properties. These materials are remarkably

stable chemically; they are inert toward acids and alkalies, 
as well as many fats and oils. 

Plaster of Paris. This is frequently used to support large 
glass bulbs containing mercury. The plaster suspended in 
water to the consistency of a paste is cast between the bulb 
and a loose-fitting wooden support. Salt shortens the time 
required for plaster of Paris to set, while a trace of glue acts 
in the opposite way. The glass may first be wiped with oil 
so that the plaster will not adhere to it. This facilitates 
subsequent dismantling. 

Litharge and glycerin. This combination gives a cement 
useful for the same type of applications for which plaster of 
Paris is useful. It is inert toward water, most acids, and all 
alkalies, and holds up to temperatures of 260°C. It is 
prepared by mixing pulverized Litharge (which has been 
first thoroughly heated at 400°C.) with pure glycerin to the 
consistency of a paste. 21 

Other irreversible cements. Water glass forms cements 
when mixed with the carbonates or oxides of calcium, mag- 
nesium, zinc, lead, or iron. In a few hours these mixtures 
set to rock hardness. Combined with talc, water glass 
makes a cement which holds even at a red heat. This 
cement will not chip off from glass at liquid air temperatures. 

Zinc oxychloride cement is used extensively in dentistry. 
It is formed from a 60 per cent zinc chloride solution and 
zinc oxide powder mixed to the consistency of a thick paste. 
These constituents react to give zinc oxychloride. To 
insure that the oxide is free from carbonate, it should first be 
heated until it turns yellow to calcine the carbonates. 

Nine parts kaolin mixed with one part borax give a cement 
useful to 1600°C. The constituent powders are mixed, and 
water is added to facilitate application. After the water 
evaporates, the cement is slowly heated to a yellow heat in 
order to set it. 

Insa-lute cement, a commercial product, is a thick white

suspension of refractory substance in water glass. It sets on 
drying to form a white material having the texture of porce- 
lain. It is an electrical insulator and stands firing to about 
1100°F. It adheres to metal, glass, and porcelain. It 
attacks chromium-alloy wire at elevated temperatures and 
should not be used in contact with it. One should use a 
refractory cement such as Alundum cement in contact with 
chromium-alloy wires. 

Glue. Unquestionably, the best bonding material for 
wood is glue. Glues are more effective for the lighter woods, 
which contain less oils and resins, than for the dense woods. 
There are three kinds of glue: casein, blood albumin, and 
animal glues. The first two are useful for general construc- 
tion work. The animal glues exhibit greater strength, but 
they are softened by moisture. Casein glue is made from 
milk protein and lime. Blood glues contain caustic soda and 
water glass. Both the latter glues require heat and pressure 
for their application. They are water resistant and are used 
for making plywood. 

Animal glue is best applied hot. Cabinet and pattern 
makers usually keep a hot glue pot. For occasional use, 
however, air-drying glues are quite satisfactory for joining 
wood as well as leather. Air-drying glue is applied to the 
surfaces which are to be fastened together. The glue films 
on these surfaces are allowed to dry until the glue is definitely 
stringy. At this stage the surfaces are clamped together, 
and the glue is allowed to become completely dry. 

Lubrication. There are two kinds of lubrication with 
liquids. In the first and most common kind, called com- 
plete lubrication, the bearing surfaces are separated by an 
oil film about .005 inch in thickness. The friction, and con- 
sequently the amount of heat produced in the lubricant, 
depend on the film thickness and viscosity of the liquid. 

In the second kind of lubrication the surfaces are in con- 
tact. Friction and galling are diminished and prevented by 
a surface film. The tenacity with which this liquid film 
adheres and the effectiveness with which it reduces friction 



564 



MATERIALS OF RESEARCH [Chap. XIII 



are determined by a quality called the oiliness of the liquid. 
The lubrication of surfaces in contact is called boundary 
lubrication. In general, mineral oils are more suitable for 
the first type of lubrication, and vegetable and animal fats, 
as well as soaps, are more suitable for the boundary lubri- 
cation. The friction in the case of boundary lubrication is 
usually less when the surfaces are covered with a surface 
film of high molecular weight. High viscosity (which is 
associated with high molecular weight) gives more friction 
in the case of complete lubrication. 

Sir Wm. B. Hardy and Miss Ida Doubleday 22 have studied 
the coefficient of boundary friction for various materials, and 
the results of their study are illustrated by Fig. 13.

against the molecular weight of the lubricant as abscissa. 
The paraffins and the alcohols and acids of the paraffin 
series are the liquids used as lubricants. 

We see that for very high molecular weights, particularly 
in the case of the fatty acids, the coefficient of friction is 
expected to be zero, and, indeed, for some compounds Hardy 
found the static friction to be less than the minimum amount 
that he could measure. 

Of these results, Hardy and Doubleday say: 

It will be seen that for each chemical series, and for each solid, 
the curve is a straight line. The equation is therefore 

n = b — aM 

where M is molecular weight and a and b are parameters. The 
effect of the nature of the solid face is unexpectedly simple. In 
changing from glass to steel the curve for a series is merely moved 
parallel to itself, and in changing from steel to bismuth there is a 
further shifting. Therefore, in the equation the parameter a is 
independent of the nature of the solid face and dependent only on 
chemical type, varying from one chemical series to another. The 
parameter b, on the other hand, is dependent upon the nature of the 
solid face as well as upon the chemical series. 

From the above expression one might expect the co- 
efficient of friction for two dissimilar surfaces to be a 
mean of the coefficient for the two separate surfaces, and 
Table VIII, from the paper of Hardy and Doubleday, shows 
how well this expectation is realized. 

The addition of a small amount of fatty acid to a mineral 
oil materially improves lubrication, especially where the 
bearing surfaces come in contact and the character of lubri- 
cation changes from the complete type to the boundary type. 
The higher efficiency of boundary lubrication obtained in this 
way is due to the adsorption of a fatty acid film of high 
molecular weight on the bearing surfaces. 

The qualifications of a lubricant for use in a scientific 
instrument often depend primarily upon the ability of the 
lubricant to form stable films which cover the surface of the

metal and produce a diminution of static friction between 
sliding metal parts. Oils which are rich in vegetable or 
animal fats are superior to petroleum oils in this regard. 
Hydrated lanolin is an excellent lubricant for sliding friction 
heads in which a low starting (or static) friction is important. 
Unfortunately, it is somewhat corrosive. 

Colloidal graphite added to oil is similarly adsorbed on 
bearing surfaces. It is useful for the lubrication of spectrom- 
eter cones and, in machinery, it is especially useful for the 
running-in operations to form a hard polished Beilby layer 
on the bearing surfaces. 23 

For extremely heavy-duty lubrication, mutton fat or 
Dutch grease is recommended. Dutch grease is simply a 
combination of mutton fat with heavy petroleum oils. 

It is desirable for clocks and other delicate mechanisms 
to have an oil that is chemically stable, does not corrode the 
metal parts, does not escape by spreading or evaporating, 
and does not freeze easily.

The oils from the head and j aw of the porpoise (Nye watch 
oil) and blackfish satisfy these qualifications most com- 
pletely. These oils, however, are quite expensive ($125.00 
a gallon). Sperm oil is next in quality. 

Soap is a good lubricant for wood. Water is used between 
rubber and metal surfaces. Talc is often used as a dry 
lubricant for nailing and so forth. Also, graphite, especially 
colloidal graphite, forms a good dry lubricant at ordinary 
and elevated temperatures. It is used for lubricating lock 
barrels. Colloidal graphite dispersed in water or glycerin 
has film-forming properties which recommend it for some 
applications. The glycerin dispersion is useful at low 
temperatures. 

Soapstone. 24 When soapstone, or massive talc, is heated 
to 500°C, it gives off absorbed water. Heating it to 850°C. 
drives off the remaining water, and finally heating to 1300°C. 
gives a complete transformation of the mineral constituents. 
When the material is transformed, the corresponding over- 
all change of hardness is from 1 to 6 on Moh's scale. Owing 
to these properties, soapstone is very useful in the laboratory, 
since it can be easily machined before it is fired, and after it 
is fired it gives a hard material having many desirable prop- 
erties. The shrinkage from firing is less than 1 per cent. 
Firing from 24 to 48 hours at 1100°C is the usual practice. 
It is said that a material with iron content is not suitable for 
use in a vacuum, since it gives off gas. Imported Italian 
soapstone is exceptionally free from iron impurities and is 
obtainable in large blocks. 25 

Finely divided talc can be pressed and fired at 1400°C, 
giving a sintered body like that obtained from the massive 
mineral. The shrinkage of the powder on firing is about 
8 per cent. After firing, it has the property that it is not 
attacked by acids or alkalies. It can be welded to glass.

Talc, both fired and unfired, is chemically inert; it is not 
attacked by acids (except slowly by hydrochloric acid) or by 
alkalies. Fig. 14 shows the electrical resistance of talc and
