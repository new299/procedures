Wedge spectrograms are illustrated in the lower sections 
of Fig. 2. These spectrograms were taken using sunlight 
and the light of a tungsten lamp as the light source. The 
height of the shaded areas indicates the sensitivity of the 
emulsion. 

Owing to the emission characteristics of these light sources 
and the opacity of the lenses used for violet and ultraviolet 
light, the wedge spectrograms exhibit maxima at about 
4700 A, whereas, actually, the sensitivities of the emulsions, 
as indicated by the curves at the top of Fig. 2, show the 
maxima to be in the ultraviolet. However, the wedge 
spectrograms do give an indication of the performance of 
different emulsions in the camera. 

Table I illustrates the relative sensitivities of the eye and 
the photographic plate to a line-shaped light source on a dark 
field. This table, together with the appearance of a spec-

in which T is the transmission of the film or plate in question. 

The shape of the H and D curve depends upon the char- 
acter of the emulsion, and also, if colored light is used, upon 
the wave length or color characteristics of the light used for 
exposure. Actual photographic materials may exhibit a 
curve differing considerably from the one shown in Fig. 3. 
For example, the curve does not always exhibit a definite 
straight segment in which A is proportional to the logarithm 
of exposure. The curve of Fig. 3 is somewhat idealized, but 
it represents the general character of the relationship be- 
tween A and log S. 

The exposure range represented by the straight segment is, 
by definition, the latitude of the emulsion. Table II gives 
the latitude of typical emulsions, from which we see that fast

emulsions have the greatest latitude and lantern slides and 
process emulsions the least, the variation of latitude in these 
emulsions being eightfold. In Table II the latitude is 
expressed as the ratio of the exposure at the upper end of the 
straight segment to the exposure at the lower end.

The contrast of an emulsion, y, is, by definition, the slope 
of the straight segment of the H and D curve. If this seg- 
ment makes an angle a with the log 2 axis, 

7 = tan a. (2) 

The contrast varies with development time but tends to 
approach a limit as the development time is increased. This 
limiting value, y„, allows comparisons to be made between 
the contrast characteristics of various types of emulsions. 
Values of 7 co for different emulsions are given in Table III. 
It will be noted that positive films, lantern slides, and process 
emulsions exhibit the most contrast, while fast emulsions 
exhibit less contrast. 

The curve shown in Fig. 4, the so-called Weber-Feckner 
curve, illustrates the variation of the subjective response of

The Weber-Feckner curve employs the logarithm of 
field brightness as abscissa, and this curve exhibits an inflec- 
tion point near which it is closely approximated by a straight

indicates why photographs look natural. It also indicates 
why the ordinary fading type of exposure meter works as 
well as it does. 



Chap. XI] PHOTOGRAPHY 455 

The contrast sensitivity of the eye is related to the slope 
of the Weber-Feckner curve, and it is such that one can 
just distinguish a difference in brightness of about 2 per cent 
between contiguous uniformly illuminated fields. It is of 
interest to point out that the contrast of a field can be en- 
hanced by photography by about ninefold — threefold by the 
photographic process of taking the primary photograph and 
threefold by the printing process. Accordingly, it is possible 
to see detail in a photograph which is invisible to the unaided 
eye. 

The H and D speed of a photographic material S is defined 
as 34 divided by the inertia expressed in lumen seconds per 
square meter. „ . 

£ = ~ (3) 

t 

The inertia, illustrated in Fig. 3, is the exposure repre- 
sented by the intersection of the extrapolated straight seg- 
ment of the H and D curve with the line A = 0. 

Reciprocity law. The photophysical and photochemical 
effects produced in a plate by the exposure 2 are measured 
by the density A. Equal effective exposures 2' produce 
equal densities under the condition of controlled develop- 
ment. To a degree of approximation sufficient for most 
applications (precise photometric photography excepted) 
the effective exposure is equal to the product of the illumi- 
nation on the plate, I, multiplied by the time of exposure t. 

Thus ' S' = 2 = It. (4) 

This is the so-called Bunsen and Roscoe reciprocity law. 

For greater accuracy it is necessary to replace Eq. 4 by 
more complicated expressions. One of them, Schwarz- 
schild's, 3 takes into account the difference in effectiveness 
when the emulsion is exposed a short time to a bright light 
and when it is exposed a long time to a dim light. Schwarz- 
schild's relation is given below : 

2' = I-V. (5)

PHOTOGKAPHY 



[Chap. XI 



We may take the behavior of motion-picture positive film as 
an example to show to what extent the Bunsen and Roscoe 
law fails. For the range of illumination intensities from 1 to 
33,000 it is found that p varies from 0.68 to 1.00, the maxi- 
mum intensity being 131 lumens/m 2 and the exposure time 
varying between 18.2 hours and 2.5 X 10 -4 second. 

Another factor to be considered in predicting the photo- 
graphic response to a given exposure is whether the illumi- 
nation is intermittent or continuous. The photographic 
emulsion is incapable of responding as completely to an 
exposure impressed as short flashes of light as to an equal 
uniform exposure. Also, everything else being equal, the 
photographic response is diminished if the time interval 
between flashes increases. 4 

The resolving power. The resolving power of a photo- 
graphic plate may be measured by the number of lines per 
millimeter which can be distinctly photographed. The

resolving power varies by a factor of about 2 for the ordinary 
photographic materials. For lantern-slide plates the resolv- 
ing power is about 100/mm, but for fast motion-picture film 
it is only half as great, or about 50/mm. (See Table IV.) 

Light sources. Photographs are frequently taken with 
achromatic lenses. The flint components of these lenses will 
not transmit light at wave lengths shorter than about 3300 A. 
The transmission curve for a moving-picture projection lens 
containing a flint component is shown in Fig. 5. In practice a

wave-length limit of 3800 A is often low enough to define the 
behavior of a photographic material when account is taken of 
this opacity of the lenses used and also when the ultraviolet 
emission of ordinary light sources is considered. 

The spectral energy distributions in the light of various 
tungsten lamps used for photography are given in Fig. 6. 
It will be noted that the emission is weak at short wave 
lengths. The spectral distribution of sunlight is also given 
there. As a matter of convenience for comparing the curves, 
the intensities are all set equal to 1 at 5600 A. 

The color temperatures of various sources are given in 
Table V. Of these, the photoflash lamp is of special interest.

It is of value for inside photography, since it eliminates the 
danger and smoke of flashlight powder and the expense of 
other suitable sources such as the electric arc. This lamp is 
an ordinary pear-shaped bulb filled with aluminum foil and

gether, it is necessary to apply voltage to the base of only 
one of them and the others will go off "sympathetically."

tensity from a bulb of the size of an ordinary 75-watt tung- 
sten lamp is 4 to 5 X 10 6 lumens.

Filters. For photographing with the microscope, in order 
to prevent excessive heating, it is necessary to use a water 
filter to absorb out heat radiation from the light emitted 
from the carbon arc. Frequently, copper chloride or sul- 
phate is added to the water in the cell to increase its infrared 
absorption. These additions do not materially attenuate 
the transmission of the cell for yellow, green, and blue light. 

On the other hand, when it is required to transmit the 
infrared and absorb the visible rays, one can use a cell con- 
taining a solution of iodine in carbon disulphide. 

Color filters for use in photography can be made up from 
solutions, or they may be purchased in the form of colored 
gelatin films, either unmounted or mounted between glass 
plates. The unmounted films are the cheapest, and they

generally serve as well as those that are mounted. Trans- 
missions for some of the Wratten gelatin filters 5 used in 
photography are given in Fig. 7.

There are several preliminary procedures to be carried out 
before the photographic emulsion is ready for exposure. 
These include focusing, sensitizing, annealing, and judging 
the correct exposure time to be given. 

6 Wratten filters are handled commercially by the Eastman Kodak Com- 
pany, Rochester, New York. See the book Wratten Light Filters, published 
by that company, price 50 cents. 



Chap. XI] PHOTOGRAPHY 461 

Focusing. Focusing may be accomplished by taking 
several pictures at different positions of the plate holder or 
lens. Sometimes, however, this procedure is not the most 
convenient one. For example, in focusing the plate in an 
astronomical telescope, a "knife-edge" test may be used for 
determining the focus. This is accomplished by means of an 
attachment which is substituted for the plate holder and 
which is constructed so that the knife edge comes to the same 
plane as that occupied by the emulsion when the plate holder 
is in position. The camera as a whole is then adjusted until 
the cutting of the knife into the star image results in a uni- 
form decrease in the intensity of the rays that come from 
different parts of the mirror. After this, when the plate 
holder is replaced, the emulsion will be in focus. 

In a spectrograph a strip of paper across the center of the 
telescope or collimating lens and parallel to the slit facilitates 
the determination of the focus. When the photographic 
plate or viewing glass is not in exact focus, a double image of 
the spectrum lines is obtained. 

A uranium glass plate may be used for focusing ultraviolet 
light. The fluorescence of this glass is easily visible for the 
stronger ultraviolet lines in the mercury spectrum. 

Sensitizing. Ordinary photographic plates respond to 
wave lengths from 2400 A to 5500 A, with the maximum 
sensitivity at about 3600 A. Sensitization is required 
beyond these limits. Although the photographically active 
grains themselves are sensitive for all wave lengths shorter 
than those of the visible spectrum, the emulsion becomes less 
sensitive at wave lengths below 2800 A, because of opacity 
of the gelatin in the emulsion. Although absorption by the 
gelatin is weak at 2800 A, it increases at shorter wave lengths, 
especially below 2400 A, until the gelatin is completely 
opaque at 2000 A. Schumann made the first photographic 
plates which were sensitive at wave lengths below 2000 A 
by using a very thin emulsion almost free from the opaque 
gelatin. Not only are the Schumann plates useful for photo- 
graphing in the ultraviolet spectrum, but they also serve in 



462 



PHOTOGRAPHY 



[Chap. XI 



those applications in which the lateral motion in the emulsion 
is to be rigorously avoided or in which lateral scattering of 
light must be minimized. 

The sensitivity of ordinary photographic plates may be 
increased at wave lengths below 2400 A by coating them with 
a fluorescent substance such as oil. The sensitivity can be

increased as much as four hundredfold. A few drops of 
Nujol or some other oil are spread over the surface with a 
cotton pad. After exposure and before development the oil 
is washed away with acetone. Harrison has studied the 
sensitometry of oiled plates, and he states that they may be 
used for photographic photometry. 6

Chap. XI] PHOTOGRAPHY 463 

Plates are sensitized for the red and infrared with dyes. 
The diagram shown in Fig. 8 represents the characteristics of 
spectrum plates which are available commercially. 7 

Plates may be hypersensitized by bathing them in either 
an ammonia or a borax bath. The formulas for these baths 
are given below. 

Ammonia Formula 

Bath Temperature: 10° to 12°C. 

Ammonia (0.91 sp. gr.) 2 cc 

Alcohol 275 oc 

Distilled water 725 cc 

Immerse 2 minutes. Do not rinse. Dry as quickly as possible 
after removing surface liquid. 

Borax Formula 

Bath Temperature: 12°C. 

Sodium chloride 0.5 g 

Borax 2 to 3 g 

Distilled water 1 liter 

Immerse 2 to 6 minutes. Do not rinse. Soak in methyl alcohol 
1 minute. Dry as quickly as possible after removing surface fluid. 

The hypersensitizing action of the baths is relatively 
greater for the slower emulsions. Treatment with the 
ammonia bath can be expected to produce 100 to 400 per 
cent increase of speed for the visible spectrum, while infrared 
plates exhibit an even greater increase in speed of 500 to 
2500 per cent. Hypersensitized plates fog rapidly at room 
temperature, so that they should be used as soon as possible 
after they are dry. However, they can be kept for a few 
days in an icebox. After they are removed from the icebox, 
they should be warmed to room temperature to avoid the 
condensation of moisture when they are loaded in the 
camera. The borax treatment is said to be best for Agfa 
plates, and the ammonia bath for Eastman plates. 

Photographic plates may also be hypersensitized by a 36- 
hour exposure to mercury vapor at ordinary temperatures. 8 

7 Mees, C. E. K., J. 0. S. A., 25, 80 (1935). 

8 See Dersch, F., and Duerr, H., /. Soc. of Motion Picture Engineers, 28, 
178 (1937). The effect of exposure to the mercury vapor is said to be more 
marked after exposure than before. 



464 PHOTOGRAPHY [Chap. XI 

We see from the H and D curve given in Fig. 3 that a 
certain exposure is required before the linear part of the 
curve is reached. R. W. Wood introduced the procedure of 
pre-exposing the plate to a uniform illumination. 9 Although 
this allows the attainment of increased density with a given 
exposure, it does so with attendant loss of contrast. To 
avoid the Herschel effect, one should use, for the pre- 
exposure, a wave length that is redder than the light that is 
being photographed. Other investigators who have experi- 
mented with pre-exposure, notably Whipple in connection 
with stellar spectroscopy and Norman with photographic 
photometry, may be consulted for further details. 10 

Gelatin shifts. Annealing of the unexposed emulsion 
may be required for photographic plates such as spectrum 
plates and astrographic plates on which it is necessary to 
make measurements of the highest precision. Gelatin shifts 
may occur on account of strains, in the supporting gelatin 
layer, which are relieved by the developing process. Accord- 
ingly, the position of silver in the developed image may not 
coincide exactly with the position of the same silver in the 
latent image. Cooksey and Cooksey observed shifts of the 
latent image as great as 9/j.. 11 These authors found, how- 
ever, that such shifts are reduced about fourfold by the 
following annealing procedure : The plate is wet in a neutral 
solution, washed, and then dried by absorbing the water 
from the gelatin with alcohol. 

More frequently gelatin shifts arise on account of improper 
drying. Large shifts occur around spots where the gelatin does 
not dry uniformly. To avoid these shifts it is recommended 
that, after fixing, the plate be dried in an alcohol bath, in 
which the removal of water from the gelatin is much more uni- 
form than it is when the drying is effected by evaporation. 
It is advisable not to use a spectrum plate nearer the edge 
than 1 cm, since the gelatin shifts are greatest near the edge.

Because of their shrinking and expanding, photographic 
films are unsuitable for precise photography. The effect of 
changes in the film can, in a large part, be allowed for if 
coordinate lines (with a reseau) or, in the case of a spectrum, 
comparison spectral lines, are impressed on the plate at the 
time of exposure. 

Exposure. Photographic films and plates are ordinarily- 
exposed to get proper contrast. As long as the range of

illumination in the object to be photographed is small com-

between wide limits. As a result, the density may vary, but 
as long as the exposure falls within these limits, the contrast 
obtained will be the same. This is illustrated in Fig. 9.

If the range of illumination is greater than the latitude as 
shown in Fig. 10, the exposure should be adjusted to get 
proper contrast where it is desired. For example, if the 



466 PHOTOGRAPHY [Chap. XI 

highlights are important, the emulsion should be under- 
exposed for the shadows, and if the shadows are important, 
it should be overexposed for the highlights. 

In photography, particularly artistic photography, one 
may wish to render detail in both highlights and shadows 
even where the range of illumination may involve a ratio as 
great as 3000 to 6000 between the maximum and minimum 
exposure. Although no film exhibits such a latitude (see 
Table II), this range of exposure can often be managed by 
overexposure and underdevelopment. That this procedure 
yields less contrast and greater latitude is indicated by 
Fig. 11, in which it will be noted that the projection of the 
straight segment of the A-log 2 curve representing 32 
minutes development embraces an exposure range only half 
as broad as that embraced by the curve for 2 minutes devel- 
opment. Furthermore, the regions of exposure beyond the 
straight segment do not deviate so much from a straight line 
for the case of 2 minutes development as for the case of 
32 minutes development. 

On the other hand, when a subject is "flat," such as a 
sand dune, the professional photographer takes his largest 
camera and gives the plate a short exposure and then a long 
development to get maximum contrast. The photographer 
uses the large camera inasmuch as a long development time 
produces graininess, which becomes conspicuous on enlarge- 
ment. 

The correct exposure may be determined by means of an 
exposure meter and the tables and scales supplied with it. 
The photronic-cell type of exposure meter is especially useful, 
but it has the undesirable feature that its response represents 
an average of the illumination received over a large solid 
angle. When the exposure is to be adjusted to the illumi- 
nation of some small object which is much brighter or darker 
than its surroundings, it is necessary to put the photronic 
meter close enough to the object so that it substantially 
fills the field of view of the meter. 

Tables and calculators like the Wellcome calculator are 



Chap. XI] 



PHOTOGRAPHY 



467 



useful for roughly estimating the exposure. 12 To increase 
the chance of getting correct exposure, one should take 
auxiliary pictures at one half and twice the exposure pre- 
dicted by the calculator. Such a practice is especially 
feasible with miniature cameras, for which the cost of film 
is small. 

The speed of a given photographic material varies with 
the color characteristics of the illumination, depending upon 
whether it is sunlight, arc light, or light from a tungsten 
lamp. The exposure can be accurately estimated only after 
taking account of a color factor as well as the intensity of 
illumination. The success of an estimate depends largely 
upon the experience of the photographer. 

When unfamiliar conditions of illumination are encoun- 
tered, the correct exposure is usually determined by trial. A

Exposure required to give a perceptible image on various photographic 
materials. The values given in the table are B/a X 10~ 6 , where B is the 
intrinsic illumination in candles per square centimeter and <r is the exposure to 
give a perceptible deposit in lumen seconds per square centimeter.

succession of trial plates is taken, the exposure of each vary- 
ing by a factor of 2, 3, or 5. 

Table VI is useful for estimating exposure. This table 
gives the ratio of the intrinsic illumination B to the exposure 
<r required for the various light sources to yield a perceptible 
deposit on the photographic material indicated in the left- 
hand column of the table. 13 B is in candles per square centi- 
meter and <j in lumen seconds per square centimeter, so that 
the ratio B/a has the dimensions 1/ (solid angle X seconds). 
If the product of the quantity B/a multiplied by the solid 
angle of the illumination cone on the film and as well by the 
exposure time is equal to or greater than unity, a perceptible 
image will result. 

The values of B/a are useful for designing recording in- 
struments to determine the maximum velocity v at which 
the recording spot can traverse the film and yet produce a 
readable trace. Let us consider a recording system, say one 
to record galvanometer deflections. First, we must deter- 
mine the exposure time and solid angle of illumination. If 
the width of the spot is d, then d/v gives the exposure time 
for those areas of the photographic material which have been 
traversed by the spot. The solid angle of the illumination is 
determined as follows: 

Case I. For the case in which a galvanometer mirror of 
area A acts as field stop and the light is focused on the film 
by a spherical lens immediately in front of the galvanometer, 
the solid angle is A/fi 2 , when f x is the distance of the film 
from the spherical lens. 

Case II. For the case in which an astigmatic optical 
system is used, wherein the width of the galvanometer 
mirror, w, determines the lateral field stop, and the stop on 
the cylindrical mirror is h, the solid angle is 

w h 

/i /. 

Here, /i is the distance of the film from a spherical (or

is the distance of the film from the cylindrical lens near 
the film. (See Fig. 47, Chapter IX.)

record is

Development. The aim of development is to render in 
photographic blackening the variations in illumination regis- 
tered as the latent image in the photographic emulsion. 
Sometimes, as in a snapshot, one may wish the rendition to 
be "normal," so that the positive print will seem to represent 
faithfully the original scene. On the other hand, one may 
wish to repress or enhance contrast by changes in the devel- 
opment procedure. 

The development process is not completely understood. 
Grains of silver bromide which have been exposed to light 
are reduced to metallic silver by the developer, while those 
not so exposed are not easily reduced. The developer will, 
however, finally reduce unexposed grains. The reduction of 
unexposed grains produces a general fogging of the plate, 
called chemical fog. 

The progress of development with time is illustrated in 
Fig. 11. The various H and D curves shown here represent 
a series of exposures, on five different plates. Each of the 
plates was developed for a different length of time, namely, 
2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 minutes. It is characteristic of develop- 
ment that the contrast increases with the time of develop- 
ment. At first the increase is rapid; for example, in 2 
minutes the contrast of the material represented in Fig. 11 
increased from 0.32 at t = 2 minutes to 0.58 at t = 4 min- 
utes, an increase of 0.26. Later, the rate of increase falls 



470 PHOTOGRAPHY [Chap. XI 

off; for example, in 16 minutes the contrast increased by 
only 0.3 from 1.4 at t = 16 minutes to 1.7 at t = 32 minutes. 
The contrast approaches a limit y ^ for very long develop- 
ment. We have referred to this quantity before and tabu- 
lated it for representative photographic materials. (See 
Table III.) An interesting geometrical feature of the H and

D curves shown in Fig. 11 is that their extrapolated straight 
segments have a common intersection point with the line 
A = 0. 

Developers are composed usually of four constituents: 
(1) The reducing agent — metol (elon), pyrogallol, glycin, 
amidol, or hydroquinone; (2) the alkali accelerator — 
caustic soda, sodium carbonate, or borax; (3) the preserva- 
tive — usually sodium sulphite or bisulphite; (4) the restrain- 
ing agent — potassium bromide. 

Most developing solutions will not develop at all unless 
they are alkaline, and all of them act more rapidly in propor- 
tion to the concentration of the alkaline accelerator. 

Oxygen dissolved by alkaline solutions may oxidize the 
reducing agent. In the case of pyrogallol this oxidation is 
particularly objectionable, for it yields a yellow-colored 
product which stains the emulsion. Oxidation can be 
avoided if the preservative sodium sulphite is added to the 



Chap. XI] PHOTOGRAPHY 471 

developer. This substance rather than the pyrogallol reacts 
with the dissolved oxygen, forming sodium sulphate. 

The characteristic effect of the restraining agent, potas- 
sium bromide, is to depress the intersection point, referred to 
above, below the line A = and at the same time bromide 
suppresses development in the low exposure range. A small 
amount of bromide which is not enough to depress the inter- 
section point much will, however, exert a selective enough 
restraining effect on the development to inhibit the forma- 
tion of undesired chemical fog, without having any sensible 
effect on the development of the desired image. 

There are two general procedures for development: time 
and temperature, or tank development; and factorial, or 
tray development. By the first method, the film is im- 
mersed in a tank of developer for a prescribed length of time. 
This time is determined by the nature of the film, by the 
degree of contrast desired, and also by the type, concen- 
tration, age, and temperature of the developer. 

By the second method, the progress of the development 
may be watched. Panchromatic emulsions are desensitized 
to make this possible. The time at which the development 
is to be terminated is either determined by inspection or 
calculated from the time required for the image first to 
appear. 

Time and temperature development. The rate of develop- 
ment, as in any chemical reaction, increases rapidly with 
temperature. It is a practical rule in chemistry (although 
not a very rigid one) that a reaction rate increases by a factor 
of 2 for each 10° rise in temperature. This rule applies to 
development; for example, with pyro-soda developer this 
factor is 1.5. Time-temperature tables are available for the 
various developers. However, to get proper contrast and to 
prevent excessive graininess and fogging, it is advisable to 
carry on development at the temperature specified by the 
formula. For developers containing both metol and hydro- 
quinone it is particularly important to develop at the tem- 
perature specified in the formula in order to obtain the 



472 



PHOTOGRAPHY 



[Chap. XI 



proper proportionate effect of each reducer. Metol has a 
low temperature coefficient, while hydroquinone has a high 
one. As a matter of fact, some operators take advantage of 
this difference and use hydroquinone-metol developers warm 
to obtain one grade of contrast and cold to obtain another. 
This procedure is not recommended, but it does illustrate 
the point in question. 

The common developers may be made up from the stable 
stock solutions listed in Table VII. These solutions are 
combined in the proportions given in Table VIII at the time 
they are needed, a procedure which is at the same time both 
economical and convenient. 14

The quantities are parts, by volume. The developer is compounded in the 
order A to E in the expressed proportions and then diluted to 100 parts, by 
volume. For the first three formulas, develop at 65°F. (18°C). For papers, 
develop at 70°F. (21 °C). See Elementary Photographic Chemistry for further 
details. 

Developers such as Sease 3 give fine grain, but they re- 
quire extra exposure. So-called compromise developers, 
such as Edwal 12, yield fine grain, and at the same time they 
do not require excessive exposure. Compromise developers 
were first made for use with miniature cameras. Recently, 
however, they have had some application in astronomy. 15 
Formulas for both the Sease 3 and Edwal 12 developers are 
given below. 16

This developer keeps well and will give a finer grain when it is a 
month or two old than when it is fresh. The fineness of the grain 
produced also increases after it has been used the first time. 

For obtaining fine grain and absence of reticulation, it has 
been recommended that the temperatures of the developer, 
rinse water, fixer, and final wash water all be equal to within 
±2°F. 

Over-all density is not important for films or plates that 
are to be printed. The recommended procedure is to dis- 
regard density in development. One develops for the desired 
contrast rather than for a specified average density.

Tray development. When the emulsion is immersed in the 
developer, the time for the first appearance of the image is

PHOTOGRAPHY

proportional to the time for its full development. Accord- 
ingly, the time for first appearance of the image may be used 
to determine the proper time of development. This is help- 
ful when the concentrations of the chemicals in the develop- 
ing bath are different from those specified in the formula. 
In such a case one would not otherwise know how long to 
develop. The ratio of the time required for proper develop- 
ment to the time required for the image to appear is a char- 
acteristic of the developer and is called the Watkins factor. 
This factor varies with temperature for two-reducer devel- 
opers like metol-hydroquinone ; but for others it can be used 
to correct for high or low temperature as well as for devia- 
tions in chemical composition of the developer. Watkins 
factors for several developers are given in Table IX.

The Wellcome Handbook. 

When one is working for high contrast under conditions 
which allow observation of the progress of development, the 
rule is to develop in D-28 or D-ll until the image appears on 
the back of the emulsion. This rule applies particularly to 
the production of good lantern-slide and spectrum plates. 

Aerial fog is often encountered in tray development. It is 
caused when the plates, wet with developer, are exposed to 
the air. "Seeding" the developing solution with 5 per cent 



476 PHOTOGRAPHY [Chap. XI 

of old developer, which is rich in bromide, has a negative 
catalytic action on this fogging. The metals tin, copper, 
zinc, and their alloys often produce fog and stain on the 
emulsions when they come in contact with the developers in 
which the emulsions are treated. For this reason, develop- 
ment in brass and soldered metal trays is to be avoided. 

Plates for photometric work should be developed in a tray 
in a deep solution and brushed continuously with a camel's- 
hair brush. This accelerates convection near the emulsion 
and results in more even development. Regions in which 
the film has a strong exposure give off bromide during devel- 
opment, and unless this is removed by brushing, it restrains 
further development both at the place it is generated and at 
adjacent regions in the emulsion. 

Plates and films should be held by their edges, ends, and 
corners, and the fingers should not be allowed to come in 
contact with the important areas of the emulsion. In some 
cases the use of rubber gloves is indicated. Important 
plates should be rinsed in water before development. 

Desensitizing. Panchromatic emulsions must ordinarily 
be developed in the dark. However, the Luppo-Cramer 
discovery of the desensitizing action of phenosafranine on 
the unexposed silver grains allows illumination of panchro- 
matic emulsions with a green safelight during the latter 
stages of development. The selective desensitizing action 
of this dye on unexposed silver bromide grains is quite mys- 
terious; the development proceeds after the light is turned 
on as it would in darkness. The plate is separately im- 
mersed in the desensitizing solution for 2 minutes in darkness 
before development (1 part of a stock solution, of \ g pheno- 
safranine in 1 liter distilled water, to 10 parts water). Pina- 
kryptol green added to the developer may be employed as 
desensitizing agent. The stock solution is a 1 :500 solution 
of the dye in distilled water — 2 to 3 cc of this solution is 
added to each 100 cc of developer. 17

Chap. XI] PHOTOGRAPHY 477 

Fixing. After proper development and washing, it is 
often adequate to fix the plate or film by immersion in a 
20 per cent solution of sodium thiosulphate (hypo) crystals. 
The hypo dissolves out undeveloped silver bromide grains. 

The plate usually carries some developer into the fixing 
solution and if the fixing solution contains no preservative, 
the transposed developer will be gradually oxidized and form 
products which may stain the film. Accordingly, to avoid 
this effect, fixing solutions are usually compounded with the 
preservative sodium sulphite added to the hypo. A weak 
acid is also added to neutralize alkali brought in on the 
plates. The acid has the further function of stopping 
development. Fixing solutions may also contain hardeners, 
such as potassium or chrome alum. These hardeners "tan" 
the gelatin, prevent excessive swelling and softening of the 
gelatin, and make it less "soluble" in water. 

A short stop is used to stop development and to conserve 
the acid in the hypo. Plates are immersed in the short stop 
solution after the development and before fixing.

required to clear the gelatin of unreduced silver salts. With 
acid in the fixing bath the room lights may be turned on a few 
seconds after the plates are immersed. 

Ordinary gelatin melts in water at about 40°C. Normal 
hardening increases the melting temperature to between 
55° and 77°C. However, for extreme hardening, Formalin 
is used. In less than a minute a 5 per cent solution of this 
chemical renders the gelatin film insoluble, even in boiling 
water. Formalin does not work in acid solutions. The 
following formula is recommended by the Eastman Com- 
pany: 

Formalin Hardener

Washing and drying. It is necessary to remove the fixing 
solution from the emulsion by thorough washing. Table X 
gives the minimum time required for washing various emul- 
sions when the surface of the emulsion is held under a tap so 
that it is continually in contact with fresh water. But when 
these materials are washed in a tray without agitation, the 
diffusion of the fixing chemicals through the emulsion pro- 
ceeds more slowly. As a working rule, the washing time 
should not be less than the time required to wash the emul- 
sion under the tap plus the time required to wash the tray. 
The latter time is determined by measuring the time required

to clear the tray of a strongly colored ink solution. The 
rate of washing is roughly independent of temperature, and 
it is also unaffected by hardening if the hardened emulsion

recommended. Fig. 13 illustrates methods for washing

Plates and films are usually dried in a current of dust-free 
air. The air can be slightly warmed, since the heat of 
evaporation will keep the emulsion cool. Apparatus suitable 
for this is illustrated in Fig. 14. Fig. 15 shows a drying 
cabinet for films. 

The dry emulsion on negatives is about 0.0005 of an inch 
thick and normally contains 8 to 16 per cent moisture. It 
is five to seven times as thick as this when it is wet. The 
swelling of gelatin is characterized by the fact that it is 
anisotropic, being perpendicular to the glass. Even when

gelatin is free from the lateral restraint, offered by the glass 
support, the swelling is principally in one direction. How- 
ever, when the film dries unevenly, silver grains are shifted 
laterally. The edge of a plate dries first, and the shifts 
produced are appreciable as far back from the edge as 1 cm. 
Drops of water (tears) or the excessive water held around a 
dust particle will produce lateral shifts of the emulsion. To 
avoid these shifts, the emulsion may be wiped with a damp 
cotton pad, a chamois skin, or better yet, a cellulose sponge. 
An automobile windshield wiper can be used to remove 
tears from plates and films. 
The plate can be dried in 80 per cent alcohol when maxi-

mum accuracy to the edge of the plate is desired and also 
when distortions such as those caused by dust specks and 
tears are to be avoided. The alcohol is then evaporated 
from the emulsion by a current of moist air. If the alcohol 
or the air is too dry, the water in the gelatin will be reduced 
below the normal amount, and this subnormal water content

turns the gelatin white. The water content of the gelatin 
can be raised to remove the milky appearance by breathing 
on the emulsion once or twice. 

Printing and enlarging papers. Negatives are printed on 
so-called printing-out papers, gaslight papers, or bromide 
papers. Printing-out papers are exposed to light through 
the negative until the image develops. The chloride (gas- 
light) papers are exposed and then developed with chemical 
developers. They are relatively insensitive and can be 
manipulated in a lighted room. Bromide papers must be 



482 PHOTOGRAPHY [Chap. XI 

managed in darkness or under a safelight, in the same 
manner as ordinary unsensitized photographic plates are 
managed. The chloride and bromide papers are the most 
important, and we will discuss them here. 

The reflectivity-density A for papers is defined as follows :

are illustrated in Figs. 16 and 17. It is to be noted that the 
contrast of these papers, or slope of the straight segment of 
the A-logS curve, does not change much with increasing 
development time. The contrast is more of an intrinsic 
property of the emulsion than it is with plates and films. 
Papers are obtainable commercially in various grades, so 
that if one paper does not give the desired contrast, another 
grade is used. 

The procedure for exposing and developing papers is 
different from that recommended for plates and films. 
Proper contrast is important with plates and films, while 
density is not so important. On the other hand, correct 
density is important for papers. The procedure for exposing 



Chap. XI] 



PHOTOGRAPHY 



483 



bromide paper, for example, is to adjust exposure so that 
development for 3 minutes yields proper density. 

Development for 3 minutes rather than the 2 minutes 
usually prescribed yields more contrast in the highlights, as a 
perusal of the curves of Fig. 17 will show. For the exposure 
range below 10 lumen seconds/m 2 , it will be noted that the 
inclination of the H and D curve to the abscissa is greater 
for the 3-minute development than it is for the 2-minute 
development. 

The proper exposure is determined with narrow test strips 
of paper. When the density is correct, the image shows a

thin veil of blackening in the highlights, compared with the 
clear unexposed margins. A common fault in improperly 
printed negatives arises from overexposure and under- 
development. Never develop papers for less than 2 minutes. 

Table XI gives the relative speeds of different papers, so 
that once the exposure is determined for one grade, that for 
another may be calculated approximately. These values 
are not and cannot be precise because of unavoidable varia- 
tions in manufacture. Nevertheless, the table is of value for 
practical work. 

If, in development, a portion of the print fails to come up 
at a satisfactory rate, owing to an extra high local density 
of the negative, development may be accelerated locally by 



484 



PHOTOGRAPHY 



[Chap. XI 



applying a piece of cotton wet with warm water or simply 
by warming the film with heat from the fingers, rubbed on 
the selected spot. 

Some of the organic developers, particularly amidol, are 
poisonous. The toxicity of developers varies for different 
people, but contact may be avoided if wooden tongs are used 
for manipulating prints in the developer. (See Fig. 12.) 
The print is moved around or the solution is stirred as 
development progresses. Care must be taken not to allow 
the wooden tongs to come in contact with the acid of the 
short stop or hypo of the fixing solution, since these chemicals 
would ruin the developer solution. 

Prints are washed conveniently in a cascade of flat pans as 
illustrated in Fig. 13. As the fixing of each print is com- 
pleted, it is put in the bottom pan. But before this is done, 
the print in the top pan is removed, and the print in the 
second pan is advanced to the top, and so forth, until the 

bottom pan is emptied to 
make ready for the one in the 
hypo bath. The prints, after 
washing, are laid emulsion 
side down on a cheesecloth 
tray to dry. 

As soon as the prints are 
dry, they are bent along their 
diagonals in the manner illus- 
trated in Fig. 18 to remove 
wrinkles. They are then ready 
for mounting. It may be desirable to flatten them out further 
by pressing them between the leaves of a book or magazine. 

Glossy prints are squeegeed on enameled plates, using a 
solution of paraffin or Ozokite in benzene to prevent the 
print from sticking. The solution should be rubbed dry 
and polished with cheesecloth before the print is squeegeed. 
Also, for drying glossy prints, chromium-plated brass sheets 
are now available which do not require paraffin or Ozokite, 
but only need to be washed and wet with water.

Intensifying and reducing. The function of intensifying 
is to increase contrast, whereas the function of reducing is 
primarily to decrease the density. Reducing may, however, 
increase or decrease contrast or leave it unaltered, depending

on the solutions used. The processes of intensifying and 
reducing will correct errors in the original development, but 
they will not satisfactorily correct errors of exposure. 

The chromium process of intensification will be treated 
here. It gives a permanent intensified image, in contrast 
to the mercury process, which is not permanent. To apply 
the chromium process, the gelatin should be first bathed in a 
hardening solution. After this, the emulsion is bleached 
clear in a mixture of 1 part of the following stock bleaching 
solution with 10 parts water.

The bleached emulsion is then washed for 5 minutes and 
redeveloped, after which treatment it will exhibit greater 
contrast. It is then thoroughly fixed and washed. The 
process may be repeated to obtain even greater contrast. 
The intensification process does not need to be carried out 
in the dark. 

To obtain extreme contrast the intensified negative is 
printed on a transparent film, which is then intensified and 
printed again, and so on, until the desired result is obtained. 

Intensification occurs with each photographic process, so 
that often in the second photographic process (printing) 
special care is necessary to prevent the development of ex- 
cessive contrast. It may be necessary to employ a reduction 
procedure. The various formulas and directions for reduc- 
ing, with or without change of contrast, are given in Elemen- 
tary Photographic Chemistry. 18 

Some applications of photography. Photographs may 
be taken in the infrared with a suitably sensitized emul- 
sion, an ordinary lens, and a suitable filter, such as the 88A 
filter shown in Fig. 7. Heated objects, even a hot electric 
iron, giving off entirely invisible radiation, can be used for

Chap. XI] PHOTOGRAPHY 487 

illumination. Hypersensitizing is particularly effective in 
infrared photography. 

R. W. Wood of Johns Hopkins University and W. H. 
Wright of Lick Observatory were the first to show some of 
the striking effects that could be obtained in infrared photog- 
raphy. The penetrating power of infrared photographs, 
giving clear pictures of objects many miles distant, even 
through light haze, accounts for the present wide application 
of infrared photography, especially for aerial mapping. 

Photographs taken with ultraviolet light have yielded 
equally striking results. They may be taken through any 
of the niters that are opaque for the visible spectrum, such as 
bromine vapor, nickel sulphate solutions, thin silver films, or 
alkali-metal films. The image in ultraviolet light may be 
formed by a thin quartz meniscus lens or a quartz fluorite 
achromat. Ultraviolet photographs taken out of doors are 
free of shadows. 

From photographs of the moon taken through a silver 
film, as well as photographs taken with a bromine-vapor 
filter, R. W. Wood ascertained that a spot close to the crater 
Aristarchus was apparently covered with a layer of sulphur. 
Sulphur exhibits a high reflectivity in the visible spectrum 
and a very low reflectivity in the ultraviolet. The crater 
appeared black in Wood's ultraviolet pictures, in strong 
contrast with its surroundings. No other substance on the 
moon has been identified by means of such convincing 
evidence. 

The camera can be used for making drawings. The 
object to be copied is photographed, and an enlargement is 
made of it on matte paper. This is traced as desired with 
India ink. The paper is then treated with a bleaching solu- 
tion and the photographic image is removed. India ink is 
waterproof and unaffected by the bleaching solution. 

The following hints may aid in obtaining good results in 
the photography of apparatus for publication. In general, 
the object should be photographed against a light back- 
ground, such as a white wall or sheet. Polished surfaces on 



488 PHOTOGRAPHY [Chap. XI 

the apparatus will produce halation. The places giving 
halation (they may be determined by taking a preliminary 
picture) must be covered with vaseline and whiting. Best 
results are obtained by side-lighting from an open window or 
other light source of extended area. A good artificial source 
is obtained with a battery of photoflood lamps placed in a 
box covered with either tracing cloth or some other trans- 
lucent diffusing material. To obtain depth of focus in 
photographing apparatus, a small aperture and long exposure 
should be used. The exposure and development should be 
managed to give contrast and to show detail in the shadows. 

Miniature cameras are suited to making quantities of pic- 
tures under similar conditions (35 may be taken at each 
loading). They can be used for copying reference journal 
articles and even books. The negatives themselves may be 
used as the record, in which case they may be read with the 
film turned upside down in an improvised viewing box 
equipped with a strong reading lens, or they may be pro- 
jected on a screen. Also, the negative can be printed on 
motion-picture positive film. This does not require an 
excessive amount of time, since all the pictures have the 
same density, and they are processed in lots of 35 at a time. 
The miniature camera and projector is also useful for lec- 
tures. Graphs and illustrations can be printed on a single 
film in the order required by the lecture. 

The photographing of line drawings in pencil is difficult. 
A process emulsion should be used, and the illumination 
should strike the paper at oblique incidence to avoid specular 
reflection from the graphite pencil marks into the camera 
lens. The exposure and development are managed in such a 
way as to give maximum contrast. 

The details of the application of photography to spectros- 
copy and astronomy can only be touched upon here. In 
general, process plates are recommended for photographing 
spectra. They are best developed with D-28 or D-ll 
developer until the developed image shows up through the 
glass on the back of the emulsion. 



Chap. XI] PHOTOGRAPHY 489 

The region in the A-logS curve lying well within the 
latitude range of the emulsion is most suitable for photo- 
graphing spectrum lines. The most desirable density is 
about 0.5. The optimum light intensity for observation of 
the lines on a spectrum plate has a brightness value of about 
100 candles/m 2 . For much brighter or weaker lights the 
contrast sensitivity of the eye decreases. "Mixing up the 
grains" along the length of a weak spectrum line will ma- 
terially increase its conspicuousness. 

Photographic photometry. A spectrogram or stellar 
photograph usually serves its purpose if the intensity of the 
light is indicated approximately, provided the angular dis- 
tribution of the light is recorded with precision. The pecu- 
liar suitability of photography for observations of this kind 
is illustrated by the reference given in a footnote below. 19 
Photography may, however, be used to measure the intensity 
of light quantitatively. 

In photographic photometry, the plate is ordinarily used as 
an indicator to show, by equal densities, when the exposures 
of two areas are equal, one of the areas being produced by a 
source of known intensity, and the other by the radiation to 
be measured. It is important that the two exposures be 
made under equivalent conditions, that is, equal illumination 
and time of exposure or equal intervals of illumination if the 
light is intermittent. Also, it is important to take precau- 
tions against errors arising from variations in sensitivity over 
the surface of the plate. 

19 This property, which everyone now takes for granted, was explained by 
Fox Talbot in the early days of photography as follows: 

"Groups of figures take no longer to obtain than single figures. . . . the 
camera depicts them all at once, however numerous they be. . . . 

"It is so natural to associate the idea of labour with great complexity and 
elaborate detail of execution that one is more struck at seeing the thousand 
florets of an Agrostic depicted with all its capillary branchlets (and so accu- 
rately that none of all this multitude shall want its little bivalve calyx, requiring 
to be examined through a lens) than one is by the picture of the large and 
simple leaf of an oak or chestnut. But in truth the difficulty is in both cases 
the same. The one takes no more time to execute than the other for the object 
which would take the most skillful artist days or weeks to trace or to copy is 
effected by the boundless powers of natural chemistry in the space of a few 
seconds."

By the first procedure which we will discuss, a so-called 
step-weakener is mounted directly in front of the entrance 
slit of the spectrograph. For the first exposure, the slit is

illuminated through the step-weakener with the light to be 
measured. For the comparison exposure the slit is then 
illuminated an equal time by the light of known intensity 
and known spectral distribution, this exposure being made 
adjacent to the first exposure. 

The step-weakener may be a glass or quartz plate coated 
with strips of platinum (or some other metal) of increasing 
opacity, or it may be a series of neutral filters of gelatin. 
The illumination along the slit, which would otherwise be 
uniform, is attenuated by the step-weakener in varying 
amounts, usually in geometrical proportion.

The step-weakener is difficult to make and calibrate. 
Fig. 20 illustrates a procedure for making one by evaporation. 

From the calibration of the step-weakener at the wave 
length in question one can determine the relative light inten- 
sities of the different steps. To obtain the calibration, the 
densities of the various strips of the step-weakener are 
measured on a microphotometer. 

A photograph of the raster shown in Fig. 21 or a raster cut 
out of thin sheet metal can be used instead of a step-weak- 
ener. The use of a raster avoids the necessity for calibra- 
tion. In a uniform beam of parallel light the quantity of 
light transmitted by each element of the raster is deter-

mined by its area. The use of a raster requires an astig- 
matic optical system. The raster is ordinarily mounted so 
that, in a vertical azimuth its image is focused on the slit, 
whereas in a horizontal azimuth the parallel light transmitted 
by it is focused on the slit. 

Fig. 21 shows the ingenious way in which Frerichs has 
used a raster, taking advantage of the natural astigmatism 
of a Rowland grating setup. 21 In this setup, adjacent areas 
of the spectral image vary in intensity in the ratio 16:1 :2:4:- 
8:16. Fig. 22 illustrates the method of determining the 
relative intensities of two or more lines. The lines must be 
near each other in the spectrum, so that the differences in

sensitivity of the plate for the wave lengths involved are 
negligible and so that the H and D curves for each wave 
length are the same. Three lines photographed through the 
raster by this setup are illustrated. The densities of the 
segments of the photographed lines are measured with a 
microphotometer, and plotted as shown. It is to be noted 
that the scale of abscissa is logarithmic, the interval in 
abscissa being equal for each step of the raster. Each 
spectral line determines an H and D curve, and the lateral 
displacements necessary to bring the three H and D curves 
into coincidence determine the relative intensities of the 
lines. By this procedure an accuracy of about 3 per cent 
can be expected.
