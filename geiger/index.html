CHAPTER VII 

Geiger Counters 

BY 

H. V. Neher 



THE Geiger counter is an ion-magnifying device which is 
sensitive to individual ionizing particles. The resultant 
flow of charge, except for the so-called proportional counter, 
is practically independent of the number of ions formed by 
the original particle. Thus, in most Geiger counters an 
a particle forms from 10 2 to 10 3 times as many initial ions 
as a /3 particle; yet each gives rise to a pulse of nearly the 
same size, and each is usually registered as one particle. 

These counters have now reached a practical state of high 
development as a means of studying feeble radiations, such 
as those found in cosmic rays

and artificial or natural radio- 
activity. The mechanism of 
the gaseous discharge in the 
counters is, however, not well 
known. 

The point counter. The 
original design of Geiger 1 
consisted of a pointed wire 
surrounded by, and insulated 
from, a metal cylinder as 
shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1. A high potential of 1500 
to 5000 volts is applied across the counter, through a high 
resistance R (about 10 9 ohms). The cylinder is made

positive with respect to the point P. The pulse is observed 
by means of a string electrometer. 

Briefly, the action of the counter may be described as 
follows: The electric field immediately around the point is 
high enough so that at the pressure of the gas used any ion 
entering the space builds up by collision a large number of 
ions, which in turn build up more ions, until the quantity 
of charge which finally flows reaches the order of 10 -8 
coulomb, depending, of course, among other quantities, 
upon the applied potential. This charge, collecting on the 
distributed capacity, which may be represented by C, 
causes the potential across the counter to drop to a point 
at which the discharge can no longer be maintained, and the 
charge leaks off across the resistance R. The circuit then 
returns to its normally sensitive condition and is ready for a 
second count. The charge which builds up on C causes a 
drop in potential across R which is read by the electrometer. 
The proportional counter. The counter just discussed 
operates on a trigger principle, and the size of the pulse is 

practically independent of 
the ionization of the initial 
particle, responding alike to 
a or /3 particles. However, 
Geiger and Klemperer 2 have 
found that if a small metal 
sphere is fastened to the 
point and made positive with 
respect to the cylinder, in- 
stead of negative as in 
Geiger's original design, over 
a limited range of voltage, 
that is, within the range A

In the region from A to B the size of 
the pulse is proportional to the 
original ionization. In the region 
C to D the size of the pulse is prac- 
tically independent of the amount 
of initial ionization.

to B in Fig. 2, the pulse is approximately proportional to the 
original ionization of the particle. This circumstance makes 
it possible to distinguish between heavy particles, such as 
a rays, protons, and deuterons, and the much lighter parti- 
cles, electrons. Since 7 rays show themselves by the elec- 
trons liberated from the material they pass through, it is 
also possible to count individual heavy particles in the pres- 
ence of strong X-ray and 7 radiation. 

A design of proportional counter which has been used by 
a number of workers is shown in Fig. 3. The cylinder is

maintained at a constant negative voltage with respect to 
the ball and wire. A steel ball from 1 to 2 mm in diameter 
will give good results, but the metal of which it is made is 
unimportant. The wire or rod supporting the ball may be 
made of almost any convenient metal, and is usually about 
one half the diameter of the ball. When a heavily ionizing 
particle enters the sensitive region surrounding the ball, 
negative charges are collected. The effect is amplified by 
a linear amplifier. Since the amount of charge collected is 



262 GEIGER COUNTERS [Chap. VII 

proportional to the initial ionization, a means is here provided 
of distinguishing between heavy particles and electrons. A 
thin cellophane, lacquer, or mica window over the opening 
permits suitable gases to be used at reduced pressures. 
The threshold potential will probably lie between 1500 and 
5000 volts, depending on the kind of gas used, its pressure, 
and the geometry of the counter. 

Brubaker and Pollard 3 have studied the effects of various 
gases, using different kinds of heavy particles. Their recom- 
mendations are to use argon at pressures greater than 50 cm 
of mercury if there is a background of y radiation, while for 
a-particle or proton-scattering experiments, where y rays 
are not serious, hydrogen, nitrogen, or air between 2 and 
10 cm of mercury pressure can be used. 

If the potential on the above counter, with the small 
sphere in place of the point, is raised, a region C to D in 
Fig. 2 is reached where the effect of all particles is practically 
the same and the number of counts per unit time becomes 
almost independent of the applied voltage for a constant 
radiation. The length of this "plateau" depends primarily 
upon the distributed capacity and the resistance across the 
counter. When the point D is reached, the number of counts 
for a given radiation begins to increase, and any further in- 
crease in voltage soon sets up a steady gaseous discharge. 

Since the sensitive portion in a point counter is limited 
to a small region in the immediate neighborhood of the point, 
it is useful primarily in experiments in which only a small 
solid angle is to be studied at a time, such as in problems on 
scattering. 

The "Zahlrohr" or Geiger-Miiller counter. When it be- 
comes necessary to have a large area sensitive to ionizing 
particles, the point counter no longer can be used, and its 
place is taken by the Zahlrohr or Geiger-Miiller 4 counter 
(hereafter designated as the G-M counter). It has become 
particularly useful in the study of cosmic rays, for it is possi-

ble to use tubes of large cross-sectional area and thus have 
an accuracy comparable to that obtained with ionization 
chambers for the same time of observation. The advantages 
to be gained over the ionization-chamber method are that, by 
properly combining two or 
more G-M counters, (1) par- 
ticles incident only from lim- 
ited angles can be counted, 
and (2) background radia- 
tion due to contamination on 
the counter walls and radio- 
activity of the surroundings 
may be eliminated. 

Behavior of the G-M counter. 
Some of the properties of the 
counter may be studied by 
the arrangement shown in 
Fig. 4. The string electrometer, E, will be suitable, pro- 
vided the counter is small, that is, the number of counts 
per minute is not more than 10 to 20. The circuit constants 
should be approximately as follows: Ri = 10 9 ohms, C = 

30 cm, and R 2 = 20 X 10 6 
ohms. The tube is made nega- 
tive with respect to the wire. 
As illustrated in Fig. 5, when 
the potential, V, is raised, no 
effect will be noticed on the 
electrometer until a certain po- 
tential, known as the "thresh- 
old" voltage, V„ is reached, 
when a small increase in potential will cause the number of 
counts per unit time to rise quite abruptly to a certain 
value. 5 Any further increase in the potential will cause 

5 The abruptness of this rise depends, to a large extent, on the ratio of the 
length to the diameter of the metal tube and on the position of the central 
wire. Owing to the end effects, the part of the tube which first becomes sensi- 
tive is that near the center. As the potential is raised, this active region moves 
out toward the ends, and soon practically the whole length becomes sensitive.

very little change in the counting until a potential V m , which 
may be called the maximum operating potential of the 
counter, is reached. A small increase from here on will 
cause a sudden increase in counts, which soon goes over into 
a glow discharge. The "plateau" for a good counter and 
proper circuit constants may be 200 to 300 volts or even 
longer. This fact permits quantitative results to be ob- 
tained with G-M counters without elaborate means of regu- 
lating the voltage supply. The tube is usually operated at 
some intermediate voltage, V. 

Although both positive and negative particles are present 
in the tube, the actual multiplying agents are probably the 
electrons. The electric field is higher than necessary for 
the electrons to form ions by collision, while it is probably 
not high enough for the positive or negative ions to do so. 
The electrons rushing toward the wire form new positive 
ions and electrons, the current building up according to the 
law i = %oe ax , where a is the number of new pairs of ions 
formed per centimeter of path and is called the Townsend 
coefficient. Probably negative ions are also formed by the at- 

tachment of electrons to the 
\ 3 T| | molecules. In the ionization 

process light is given off, lib- 
erating new electrons from 
the metal tube, and these, in 
turn, form other ions as they 
rush toward the wire. This 
photoelectric process has 
been found by Christoph and

tential recovers itself according to the time constant RiC of 
the circuit, C being the distributed capacity as well as the 
capacity of the coupling condenser. 

The best way, however, to study the action of a G-M 
counter is to connect it directly to the two deflecting plates 
of a cathode-ray oscillograph as shown in Fig. 6. The other 
pair of oscillograph plates is connected to a linear sweep cir- 
cuit whose frequency can be varied. If R is about 10 9 ohms, 
then as the potential V is raised, a point is reached at which 
deflections of the electron beam will occur at random inter- 
vals of time, indicating that the G-M tube has started to 
count. As V is raised farther, the average number of pulses 
per unit time remains the same, but the magnitude, as shown 
by the oscillograph, increases by nearly the same amount 
that V increases. By such means it can be shown that the 
potential to which the voltage falls during a discharge is not 
far below the threshold, the actual amount being roughly 
proportional to the difference between the applied voltage 
and the threshold potential. 

The character of the discharge should be that shown in 
Fig. 7(a), where V T is the threshold voltage. Counters

may be divided into two main classes, "fast" counters and 
"slow" counters. The drop in potential across the counter 
is extremely rapid for a fast counter, while the recovery time 
depends upon the product of R and the distributed capacity 



266 GEIGER COUNTERS [Chap. VII 

of the circuit. If the counter is a slow one, the breakdown 
will be much less rapid, and the potential may remain near 
the threshold for a relatively long time, as much as 0.2 second 
in some cases, as represented in Fig. 7(b). When a radio- 
active source is brought up, the time spent by the counter in 
a continuous discharge state near the threshold may in- 
crease, so that the counter in a recording circuit would appear 
to be insensitive to radioactivity or even to have a negative 
sensitivity. In some cases the shape of the discharge is that 
shown in Fig. 7(c), where the breakdown is rapid at first 
but the counter fails to recover immediately, the potential 
fluctuating over wide ranges until recovery finally sets in. 

Fast counters will retain the shape of discharge curve 
shown in Fig. 7(a) when the resistance R is decreased to as 
low as 10 5 ohms. The length of the pulse in this case will be 
about 10~ 5 second. The best counters will still extinguish 
themselves when B is made as low as 4000 ohms. The width 
of the pulse on the oscillograph in this case cannot easily be 
measured, but it should be less than 10 -6 second if C is 
about 25 micro-microfarads. 

Counters with this short time constant have important 
applications when high counting rates are to be measured or 
when the number of accidentals in a coincidence circuit is to 
be kept at a minimum. In fact, it is usually necessary to use 
only two G-M counters in a coincidence circuit, for, as will 
be shown later, if each of the two counters counts on the 
average 3 times a second, then with a pulse of time width 10~ 6 
second there will be an average of only 16 accidentals per 
day. 

A complete explanation of the action of these counters 
cannot be given, but it appears that the chief agents causing 
the pulse are electrons and not negative ions, since the latter 
have much too low a mobility to be collected in these short 
times. In a slow counter there is a delaying action of 
some sort, and charges are collected over a relatively long 
period of time. It seems probable that negative ions as well 
as electrons are collected at the central wire in this case. 



Chap. VII] GEIGER COUNTERS 267 

As will be discussed presently, the surface of the cylinder has 
a vital effect upon the action of the counter. Among the 
possible physical properties which might be altered by treat- 
ment and affect the counter action could be mentioned (1) 
the work function of the surface, which would affect its 
photoelectric properties, and (2) the electrical resistance of 
the surface of the metal cylinder. At the present time, as 
already mentioned, very little is known of counter action. 

Something can be said, however, as to the treatment which 
will give counters the very desirable characteristic of furnish- 
ing an extremely short pulse. This treatment, which will 
be discussed later, is not always necessary. In fact, counters 
with copper cylinders which have never been treated have 
worked well with 10 8 ohms across them. There is, at present, 
no rule by which it can be predicted whether or not a counter 
will have this short reaction time. The proper procedure is 
to try the counter in a circuit such as that shown in Fig. 13. 
If it fails to work, then an oscillograph would show that 
when a potential slightly above the threshold is reached, the 
counter will discharge once and then remain in a continuously 
conducting state. 

Construction of G-M counters. The simplest method of 
making a G-M tube is to take a copper or brass tube of a

length at least five times the diameter, insert a hard-rubber 
plug in each end, and pass through the plugs, coaxial with 
the cylinder, a straight wire 0.1 to 0.2 mm in diameter. 
(See Fig. 8.) The wire can be made of many metals, but 
tungsten or copper will give good results. The whole must 
be made tight and the gas pressure reduced to from 3 to 6 cm

of mercury. The gas may be air or a mixture of air and one 
of the noble gases, particularly argon. 

A counter made in this fashion may work satisfactorily 
for a while, but it is not suited for constant operation over 
long periods of time. Even though the tube could be made 
perfectly tight, which is difficult, it still suffers from the 
defect of having a high temperature coefficient. Curtiss 8 
has shown that with a tube having hard-rubber ends, the 
count goes down as the temperature increases, indicating an 
increase in the density of the gas, probably due to the out- 
gassing of the hard rubber. This temperature coefficient 
can, in practice, be completely eliminated by sealing the

metal tube inside a glass tube and making metal-glass seals 
to the tungsten wires. The construction details of a counter 
of this latter design are shown in Fig. 9. Satisfactory 
counters of this copper-in-glass type have been made from 
0.5 cm to 10 cm in diameter. 

After the counter is assembled, a concentrated solution of 
nitric acid (12 to 16 normal) should be admitted and allowed 
to attack the copper vigorously for 10 to 20 seconds. The 
acid is then removed and the counter washed thoroughly 
with distilled wa'ter. Under this treatment the copper will 
turn a dark, almost black color, which probably is due to a 
thin layer of CuO. The tube is then dried, evacuated, and 
the desired amount of gas admitted.

Chap. VII] GEIGER COUNTERS 269 

The kind and amount of gas used determine to some 
extent the action of the counter. For many purposes air 
admitted to a pressure of 3 to 6 cm of mercury results in a 
very satisfactory counter. A mixture of argon and 10 to 20 
per cent air for the same total pressure will have a threshold 
perhaps 40 per cent lower than air alone. There seems to be 
little choice, however, between the mixture of air and argon 
and air only. The counter will not work with pure argon. 
The threshold potential for a counter, 2.5 cm in diameter 
with a 10-mil wire, filled with 5 cm of mercury pressure of 
argon and 1 cm of air, will be about 800 volts. The same 
counter filled with air to the same total pressure will have a 
threshold of about 1200 volts. 

Counters made according to the above directions will, in 
general, be of the slow type, that is, the collection time for the 
ions will be of the order of 0.1 to 0.01 second. Such counters 
are quite satisfactory for many purposes where short reac- 
tion times are not necessary. They may be used in the 
conventional Geiger circuit shown in Fig. 12, or if it is 
desired to eliminate the high resistance, a radio tube may 
be used to help the counter recover itself as shown in Figs. 14 
and 15. 

In case it is desired to make a fast counter, that is, one in 
which the collection time of the ions is of the order of 10 -5 
second, a different treatment of the copper cylinder is neces- 
sary. The treatment to be described is one of several known 
to produce a fast counter. A counter so treated will have 
the following characteristics: (1) The threshold potential 
will be as low or lower than for the same size counter filled 
with a mixture of argon and air at the same pressure. 
(2) The length of the plateau will be at least 30 per cent of the 
threshold potential. (3) The counter will function in the 
circuit shown in Fig. 13 with only 100,000 ohms in series 
with the high potential, instead of the 10 9 ohms necessary 
for a slow counter. (4) The efficiency is high. By ampli- 
fying the pulses, the efficiency of a 2|-inch counter was 
found to be 100 per cent at a counting rate of 30,000 per 



270 GEIGER COUNTERS [Chap. VII 

minute within the limits of experimental error, which may 
be taken to be 1 per cent. 

The procedure to make a fast counter is as follows : 

1. Starting with a copper-in-glass counter with a tungsten 
wire, clean the copper thoroughly with about 6 normal 
nitric acid. (A water aspirator is indispensable for admitting 
and removing solutions.) Such a concentration of acid will 
leave the copper very bright. 

2. After rinsing well, introduce a solution of 0.1 normal 
nitric acid. This will remove any copper compounds 
formed by the stronger acid. 

3. Rinse thoroughly (at least 10 times) with distilled water 
and dry. 

4. With dry air inside, heat the whole counter in a large 
flame until the copper turns a uniform brownish-black color. 

5. Seal the counter off temporarily and then heat for sev- 
eral hours at about 400 °C. Upon cooling, the copper 
cylinder will be coated with the bright red oxide, Cu 2 0. 

6. Evacuate and admit dry N0 2 gas to a pressure of 1 
atmosphere. (This gas can be made by the action of 16 
normal nitric acid on copper. It may be dried by passing 
through CaCl 2 and P2O5.) 

7. Heat the counter with the N0 2 until the Cu 2 turns 
a dark velvety color. 

8. Admit argon (commercial, 99 per cent pure is satis- 
factory), which has been bubbled through xylene, to a 
pressure of 6 to 10 cm of mercury pressure. The counter 
should be tried at this point. For a 1-inch counter the 
threshold should be 600 to 800 volts for 8 cm of mercury 
pressure. If the counter does not work properly, the gas 
should be pumped out and more argon, which has been 
bubbled through the xylene, admitted. 

9. When the counter is found to work satisfactorily, it 
may be sealed off. 

Although all the above steps may not be necessary in 
all cases, yet this procedure has been found to give very 



Chap. VII] GEIGER COUNTERS 271 

satisfactory counters having reaction times of 10 -6 second 
or better. The characteristics of the counters also seem to 
be permanent. The photoelectric properties as well as the 
electrical resistance of the surface are probably radically 
changed by this treatment. 

The use of a cathode-ray oscillograph is indispensable in 
the proper study of the action of a counter, and its use 
cannot be too strongly recommended. 

The above treatment is limited to copper-in-glass counters, 
and no method as yet has been found to be applicable to 
counters in general. 

Sensitivity of counters to ionizing particles. If a set of 
three identical counters are arranged one above the other, 
with their axes parallel and hori- 
zontal, and are connected to a cir- /"N /"T\ 
cuit (see page 290) which responds ^\s vL' 
only to coincidences between the ' 
three counters, then if the middle 
one is moved out of line, as shown 
in Fig. 10(a), the counting rate 
will begin to fall and, except for 
accidentals, which produce a 
small effect, the rate becomes 
zero when the middle one has 
been moved far enough so that a Fi S- 10 - Testing the sensi- 

. . , j tivity of different regions of a 

single particle cannot pass counter, 
through all three. (The count- 
ing, when the three are in a line, is due, of course, to cosmic- 
ray particles passing through the three counters.) Compar- 
ing this rate with the rate due to double coincidences between 
the two outside counters, Street and Woodward 9 have shown 
that for counters 3.82 cm in diameter the effective diameter 
is the same as the geometrical diameter. Similarly, by rotat- 
ing the middle counter 90°, as shown in Fig. 10(b), and mov- 
ing it parallel to its axis, the sensitivity along the counter can 
be obtained. With the conditions under which they were

operating and with a counter whose geometrical length was 
13 cm, the effective length was found to be 10.5 cm. The 
difference is probably dependent on the geometry of the 
arrangement as well as the potentials used. 

A set of G-M tubes arranged in a vertical line and con- 
nected to count coincidences provides a means of determin- 
ing the efficiency of a counter. If the middle counter were 
100 per cent efficient, that is, if it responded to all cosmic- 
ray particles passing through the outside counters, then, if 
proper allowance were made for the accidentals, there should 
be as many counts when the middle one is turned off as 
when it is turned on. (The counter should not actually be 
removed, since the amount of absorbing matter will then 
be changed.) By comparing the rates in the two cases, an 
actual measure of the efficiency can be obtained. A good 
counter should be at least 95 per cent efficient. It is im- 
portant that the efficiency for counters in a coincidence 
circuit be high, or the number of counts will be greatly re- 
duced. If the efficiency of each of n counters is e, the 
number of coincidences will be only e n of the number which 
would be counted if they were 100 per cent efficient. 

G-M tubes for special uses. The tube illustrated in Fig. 9 
answers very well the needs for work on cosmic rays, since 
the radiation readily penetrates the thin walls. For other 
types of radiation special constructions are necessary or are 
more efficient. A few of these will be discussed briefly. 

For /3-ray measurements, a point counter, as discussed 
on page 259, can be used at atmospheric pressure, in which 
case no trouble is experienced by the particles in entering 
the counter. In case the cylindrical counter is preferred, 
there are two alternatives : (1) Construct a thin window in the 
counter, usually at one end, or (2) if the /3-ray source can be 
placed in a large chamber where the pressure can be reduced 
to the operating pressure of the counter, the metal cathode of 
the counter can be made of very thin material. As an illus- 
tration of this latter method Smythe and Hemmendinger 10

Chap. VII] GEIGER COUNTERS 273 

have measured the activity of the potassium 40 isotope by 
using a counter with an aluminum wall 0.0254 mm thick and 
letting air at 5.6 cm of mercury pressure into the whole ap- 
paratus after the sample of potassium had been collected. 

The above procedure for /3 rays applies equally well to 
a rays or other heavy charged particles, except that in general 
the windows must be made of thinner material, owing to 
the high energy loss of these particles in passing through 
matter. However, the proportional counter (see page 260) 
or the linear amplifier of Wynn- Williams, 11 as developed by 
Dunning, 12 is usually preferable in detecting these heavy 
particles, since the effects of other ionizing agents are 
negligible. 

For the detection of y rays it is desirable to increase as 
much as possible the number of secondary electrons emitted 
from the walls of the metal tube under the action of the 
radiation. As pointed out by Evans and Mugele, 13 this 
sensitivity can be increased by (1) making the cathode ma- 
terial from one of the heavy elements, such as platinum, 
which increases the absorption of the y rays in the walls 
and produces more secondary electrons, and (2) increasing 
the surface area of the metal forming the cylinder either by 
grooving or by using a fine mesh screen. By these two de- 
vices it is possible to increase the count by a factor of two 
over that given by a plain copper electrode. The usefulness 
of a counter for measuring radiations is illustrated by the 
work of Pohl and Faessler, 14 who have shown that the in- 
tensity of a certain AgK 5 radiation required only a few 
minutes to get a measurable response with a G-M counter, 
whereas it was necessary to expose Laue X-ray film to the 
same radiation for 100 hours. 

When light of the proper frequency falls upon the inside of 
the metal tube of a counter, photoelectrons are liberated. 
Such a G-M photoelectric cell becomes a means of detecting

very feeble radiations. The metal used for the cylinder in 
the ordinary counter has its photoelectric threshold below 
the region of transmission by the glass and hence does not 
respond to the light falling upon it. For metals of this 
nature the tube may be made to respond to radiations from 
1800 A up to the threshold of the metal by cementing a 
quartz window on one end of the glass tube as shown in 
Fig. 1 1 . The central wire of tungsten should be large enough

to support itself well from one end. The free end should 
terminate in a small ball to eliminate point discharges. 

The whole tube surrounding the metal cylinder could be 
made from quartz, and quartz-glass graded seals used where 
the wires are to be taken through. 

The spectral sensitivity characteristics of counters having 
aluminum, zinc, cadmium, iron, and copper cathodes have 
been determined by Kreuchen 15 in the region 4000 A to 
2540 A. He found that they correspond in all cases for the 
same metals when used in ordinary photoelectric cells. 
Using the three metals zinc, cadmium, and copper in the 
bulk state, Kreuchen 16 also found that the sensitivity was 
increased by activating with hydrogen, but that these metals 
when evaporated showed no increase when treated with 
hydrogen. The photoelectric yield of the activated bulk 
metal and the evaporated metal was the same. 

Very little work has so far been done with cathodes of 
metals that are sensitive in the visible. Locher 17 was one

of the first to work on this problem, producing counters 
with cylinders of various metals. He tested the sensitivities 
in the ultraviolet and in the visible, both of the pure metals 
and metals coated with dyes and other foreign substances. 
Kolin 18 has succeeded in evaporating sodium, magnesium, 
and calcium onto the metal cylinder and has attained high 
sensitivities in the visible. Christoph 19 has done the most 
extensive investigation of the problem so far. Using an 
evaporated coating of calcium, he has determined the 
characteristic of the counter for ultraviolet and visible light 
and finds that consistent behavior can be obtained after 
the counter has had a chance to age. 

It appears that photoelectric G-M counters are less re- 
liable than the photoelectric cell at the present time, but, 
owing to the sensitivity attainable, the former may offer 
a fruitful field of research. 

Methods of measuring the number of counts. The string 
electrometer has been applied successfully by Rutherford 
and others 20 in counting particles up to an average of 1000 
per minute by recording the motion of the fiber on a photo- 
graphic film. This method has the advantage of simplicity 
but is limited to relatively low counts because of the response 
of the electrometer. It also has the disadvantage that the 
reading cannot be obtained immediately. The usual 
method today is to take advantage of the amplifying action 
of various kinds of vacuum and gas tubes, which eventually 
operate a mechanical recorder. 

The conventional circuit for such a recorder in its simplest 
form is shown in Fig. 12. The bias on the grid of the first 
tube is such that the plate current is only partially stopped. 
The bias on the second tube is such that it almost completely 
blocks the plate current. When an ionizing particle passes 
through the counter, the wire collects a negative charge, 
which causes the grid of Ti to go negative. The plate poten-

tial of T x rises, thus causing the grid on T 2 to go positive. 
T 2 then passes current, and if the quantity of charge is 
sufficient, the mechanical recorder 21 K will be actuated. 

The value that R must have for the counter to function 
properly will depend on the counter. For a very slow 
counter, that is, one which requires a long time for the 
charges to be collected, it may be necessary for Ri to be as

if it is capable of giving a pulse of short duration, then Ri 
may be as low as 10 5 ohms, and in some cases may be dropped 
to 4 X 10 3 ohms. For these short reaction times, the dura- 
tion of the pulse passed on to the second tube is too short 
for a vacuum-type tube, such as the 2A5, to pass sufficient 
quantity of electricity to actuate the mechanical recorder, 
and it is necessary to use either a pulse-lengthening device 
such as the multivibrator circuit to be described later, or

eliminate such a high resistance as is used in the conventional

counting rates. There are several types of circuits by which 
this may be accomplished. The first 23 is shown in Fig. 14.

of the first tube, while the potential which is applied to the 
wire is also connected to the plate of the tube through a

used on the screen grid.

resistance R 2 . The coupling to the next tube is made by 
the usual condenser, except that in this case the pulse de- 
livered is large enough to permit a small capacity C of the 
order of 10 -5 microfarad to be used instead of 10~ 3 to 10~ 4 
microfarad, as is used for the coupling condenser in the con- 
ventional circuit. 

The action of the circuit can be explained briefly as follows : 
The vacuum tube is biased close to the point at which very 
little plate current flows. The full potential of Vi is then 
across both the tube and the counter. When an ionizing

particle passes through the counter, positive charges col- 
lected by the cylinder cause the grid to go less negative. 
A current flows, causing a drop in potential across R 2 . 
When this drop becomes sufficient, the discharge in the 
counter will be extinguished, and the circuit recovers itself. 
This recovery is very rapid because of the low values of 
capacity and resistance. With such a circuit it has been 
found possible to count random pulses of 10 5 per minute 
with apparently few being missed. 

The pulse delivered to a second tube will be negative, 
which means that the plate current in this tube must flow 
continuously except when a pulse occurs. If it is desired to 
operate a power tube, then, in order to conserve power, it 
is best to use another tube such as a type 27 inserted between 



Chap. VII]

7\ and T 2 to reverse the direction of the pulse. The nega- 
tive pulse delivered by this circuit is, however, just what is 
wanted on the mixing tubes in case two or more counters 
are connected to count coincidences. 

Another method 24 of using a vacuum tube to help the 
G-M counter to recover itself is shown in Fig. 15. It will 
be noticed that no bias is used 



on the grid, so that there is 
normally a drop of only a few 
volts through the tube. Thus 
the cathode, grid resistance, 
screen voltage supply, and so 
forth, are all at a high positive 
potential. This puts a high 
positive potential on the wire 
of the G-M counter. If this 
potential is above the thresh- 
old value, then when an ion- 
izing particle passes through 
the counter, a negative charge 
collects on the grid, blocking 
off the current in the tube. 
This allows the cathode, grid, 
and so forth, to drop rapidly 
toward ground potential. As 
soon as the potential across 
the counter drops below the 
threshold value and the nega- 
tive charges have flowed off 
across Ri, however, the grid 
again takes control, and the circuit rapidly recovers itself 
and is ready for another count. 

It will be observed that the pulse taken from the circuit of 
Fig. 15 is negative. If a positive pulse is desired, a resist- 
ance of perhaps 2 X 10 5 ohms may be placed in the plate 
circuit and a positive pulse to the next stage taken off as

shown in Fig. 16. If, in addition, it is desired to eliminate 
the screen supply battery, a bleeder may be used as is also 
shown in Fig. 16. When this resistance is placed between 
the high-voltage supply and the cathode, there is a definite 
end to the plateau, owing to the fact that the potential across 

the counter cannot drop be- 
low a certain value, which is 
determined by the ratio 
R 4 /R 2 . Consequently, if the 
high voltage is raised to such 
a point that this minimum 
value is above the threshold, 
the counter will not extin- 
guish itself. 

The advantages of this cir- 
cuit over the preceding one 
are as follows: (1) The cylin- 
der of the counter is grounded, 
which means that shielding is 
unnecessary and insulation 
less troublesome. (2) For 
large counters the reaction 
time is less, since only the 
capacity of the wire, which 
is small, plays a part. (3) 
Either a positive or a nega- 
tive pulse may be taken off. 
(4) The potential across the 
radio tube is not so large. 
The disadvantages are as fol- 
lows : (1) An insulated filament supply must be used. (2) The 
high-voltage supply must be able to stand from 0.5 to 1 
milliampere of current continuously. 

This latter circuit has been applied to some large counters 
for cosmic-ray work. Since the number of counts for a 
given solid angle subtended by counters counting coinci- 
dences goes up with the area of the counters, there is a de-

cided advantage in increasing the size of the counter tubes. 
In this instance, copper tubes 5 feet long with a xV-inch 
wall were employed. Some 12 inches of space were used at 
one end to mount two of the radio tubes. The arrangement 
is shown in Fig. 17. The Pyrex bowls which seal the ends 
are commercial transmitting station lead-in bowls, with the 
edges ground to fit inside the 6-inch tubing. Commercial 
argon, 99 per cent pure, was used at a pressure of 7 cm of 
mercury. The counting rate of each counter, which is due 
to cosmic rays and radioactivity in the counter and sur- 
roundings, was about 100 per second. The resolving time 
was 2 X 10 -5 second with the constants shown in Fig. 15. 
This means that with three counters separated in a horizontal 
plane the accidentals were about 5 per hour. 

Because of the short duration of the pulse in the preceding 
circuits, it is sometimes difficult to operate a mechanical 
recorder by using an amplifying tube such as that shown in 
Fig. 12. It is much more satisfactory to use a gas-filled 
trigger-type tube, such as the argon type 884, 885, or a 
mercury- vapor thyratron. 25 The former are quite inex- 
pensive, have a short de-ionization time, and are preferable 
to the latter. One of the most satisfactory methods for 
using this tube has been devised by Pickering. 26 It is shown in 
Fig. 13 and in Fig. 18B, in which the second type of extin- 
guishing circuit described above feeds the recorder circuit. 
The grid of the 885 is self-biased to a little beyond the 
point at which it can keep control. When the positive pulse 
from circuit A causes the gas discharge to take place in the 
885, current flows through the recorder K, causing it to 
record a count. As the current continues to flow, C 2 



26 Each of these tubes has a very low plate resistance when in the conducting 
state. If the grid is sufficiently negative, no plate current will flow, but as 
soon as the grid potential is raised beyond a certain point, a gaseous discharge 
occurs, and the grid loses complete control. If a resistance is in series with the 
plate, the drop in potential inside the tube becomes approximately the ioniza- 
tion potential of the gas, or about 17 volts in the case of the argon tubes. The 
discharge can be stopped by dropping the plate potential below the ionization 
potential of the gas for a few microseconds.

charges up, and the potential of the cathode approaches 
that of the plate. However, the grid has remained near 
ground potential, so that the effective bias becomes very 
large. When it becomes large enough, and the drop of po- 
tential across the tube becomes sufficiently small, the gaseous 
discharge ceases, and the circuit returns to its normal state.

not be necessary, depending on the impedance of the re-

the circuit is usually shorter than that of the mechanical

This natural pulse length is determined chiefly by the feed- 
back capacity C 4 , Fig. 19. The quantity of electricity which 
flows during a pulse is quite sufficient to operate a Cenco

can be delivered for any predetermined time up to say 0.1 
second, provided the impedance of the output circuit is 
sufficiently low. In case this type of circuit is desired, in- 
stead of using a thyratron such as the type 885, the arrange- 
ment in Fig. 19 may be substituted directly for the two 
tubes in Fig. 13. It has many applications where a non- 
linear, constant pulse size output is desired. By adjusting 
the grid voltage on the second tube the circuit can be made 
nonsensitive to input pulses less than a certain size. For all 
pulses with a voltage swing beyond this limiting value, the 
size of pulse in the output will be constant, provided the 
pulse length in the input is less than the natural pulse length 
of the output. 

The behavior of the circuit may be described briefly as 
follows: Ti is biased so that it acts as a linear amplifier. 
T 2 is biased to just beyond the cutoff. When a negative 
pulse arrives at C h T\ passes a positive pulse onto T 2 , and 
owing to the large condenser C 3 , the grid of T 2 follows closely 
the plate of 7\ and hence goes positive by an amount de- 
pending on Ri and the type of tube TV As the plate of T 2 
drops in voltage, a negative pulse is passed back onto the 
grid of T h causing T 2 to become still more conducting. 
This process continues until the plate of the second tube has 
dropped to within a few volts of the potential of its cathode. 
The grid of T\ is now far below the potential of its cathode, 
and the charge on C 4 must leak off across R 2 . While this is 
occurring, T 2 is still highly conducting. When the grid of 
T\ returns to a point where the first tube again begins to 
conduct current, the plate of T 2 is allowed to rise in potential, 
and this in turn causes Ti to be still more conducting. The 
process is just the reverse of the initial stages of building up 
the pulse. The make and break of the current in the plate 
circuit of the second tube is extremely rapid, each appearing 
to consume less than 10~~ 6 second, provided there is a pure 
resistance load. The time during which the plate current 
in T 2 remains at its constant value can be determined by CV 
As an illustration, when d = 2 X 10 -4 microfarad in either 



286 GEIGER COUNTERS [Chap. VII 

of the circuits shown in Fig. 19, the length of pulse in the 
output is about 5 X 10~ 4 second when a pulse the length of 
which is 10 -5 second is fed to the input. 

When the bias of T 2 is lessened, there comes a point when 
the circuit will become unstable and oscillate. Just before 
this point is reached, the sensitivity becomes extremely high. 
The point at which oscillations begin depends on C 4 — the 
larger C 4 , the greater must be the bias voltage on T 2 . Using 
a type 6C6 and a type 41, with C 4 = 0.5 X 10 -4 microfarad 
and the other constants those given in Fig. 19, a 0.007-volt 
pulse input of 10~ 6 second duration results in a full voltage 
swing of the plate. This is a voltage amplification of about 
2.5 X 10 4 . For an output pulse of longer duration, for 
example, 10 -2 second, C 4 must be about 10~ 3 microfarad. 
In this case, for stable operation, T 2 must be biased such that 
a 3- to 4-volt pulse is needed on the input. 

The circuit is adaptable for use with either a fast or slow 
G-M counter. If used with a fast counter, the negative 
pulse from the wire of the counter can be fed onto the grid 
of Ti directly or through the condenser C\. In case a slow 
counter is used, Getting 27 has pointed out that such a multi- 
vibrator circuit can be made to extinguish the counter in a 
way similar to the action of the circuits in Figs. 14 and 15. 
For such operation the wire of the counter is connected 
directly to the grid of 7\ with R 2 = and Ri = 4 X 10 6 ohms. 
The cylinder of the counter has a negative potential applied 
equal to the threshold voltage plus 100 volts. The value 
of Ci is adjusted to the reaction time of the individual counter 
as well as the reaction time of the recorder. A value of 
3 X 10~ 4 microfarad is an average. The length of the 
plateau, however, is limited to the voltage swing of the out- 
put tube. 

If the counts per unit time become too large, the mechani- 
cal recorder will miss an appreciable number. It is shown 
on page 299 that if any device can respond to only those 
impulses separated by a time interval greater than r, then 

« Getting, I. A., Phys. Rev., 53, 103 (1938). 



Chap. VII] GEIGER COUNTERS 287 

the relative number of pulses missed, if they are spaced at 
random in time, is tN, where N is the average number of 
pulses per unit time. To overcome this difficulty, Wynn- 
Williams 28 has devised a scale-of-two circuit which cuts 
down the number of pulses by a factor of just two. It 
consists of two tubes such as the type 885, each tube being 
discharged by every other pulse. If another scale-of-two 
circuit is connected to one of the tubes of the first circuit, 
each tube of the second will respond alternately to half of 
the original pulsas. Thus, one tube of the second circuit 
responds to only one fourth of the original number of pulses. 
This process of adding more scale-of-two circuits may be 
continued indefinitely, with one tube of the final circuit 
counting 2~" of the original pulses, where n is the number 
of scale-of-two circuits. 

A diagram of a modified 29 set of two of these scale-of-two 
circuits is shown in Fig. 20. The action is as follows: Let 
tubes 3 and 6 have a gaseous discharge. This state of affairs 
can be obtained by first closing Si and then S 2 . The current 
through tubes 3 and 6 will cause a drop in potential across 
R 2 and Ri, which will bias tubes 2 and 5 so that they will 
not glow when S 2 is closed. The ratio of the plate potential 
to the grid potential for the grid to keep control is about 
10 to 1 for the type 885 tube. However, to secure consistent 
action it is best to have this ratio somewhat lower. Ratios 
from 5 to 1 to 8 to 1 are recommended. Let a negative pulse 
be delivered to tube 1. A positive pulse will be passed on to 
tubes 2 and 3. Tube 2 will then become conducting, the 
drop in potential from plate to cathode becoming the ioniza- 
tion potential of the argon, or about 17 volts. The dis- 
charge of tube 2 thus causes a sudden drop in potential across 
Rs which is passed on through C 4 to the plate of tube 3. 
But since tube 3 was conducting, i? 9 already had a large drop 
in potential across it, and the additional pulse passed on

through C4, makes the plate of tube 3 go negative with respect 
to the cathode. The discharge is extinguished, and its grid 
then takes control. Tube 2 is now glowing, and tube 3 is in

will receive a positive pulse only when tube 3 is made non-

tube is inverted, so that it passes on a positive pulse as well 
as responds to a positive pulse but is relatively insensitive 
to negative pulses. The number of pulses which appear at 
C 9 is then only one fourth of the number impressed on Ci. 
The unit from (a) to (b) may be considered a scale-of-two 
unit, and any number may be added. The final output is 
made to actuate a self-biased recording circuit as shown in 
Fig. 18B. 

Tubes 1 and 4 act as one-way valves, keeping negative 
pulses from passing through. This makes for more con- 
sistent action, since a large negative potential applied to the 
grid of an 885 will sometimes cause it to extinguish. To 
maintain stability, it is necessary to have the time constant 
of the plate circuit greater than that of the grid circuit. 

Still another method is available for counting impulses 
delivered at a high rate. By using a circuit somewhat 
similar to the scale-of-two, Hunt 30 has devised a scheme to 
obtain a pulsating direct current derived from charging and 
discharging condensers by means of type 885 tubes. A 
micro- or milliammeter gives a reading proportional to the 
average rate of arrival of the pulses. By choosing the proper 
capacities and resistances, this direct-frequency meter can 
be used in counting random pulses up to 10 6 per minute. 
The apparatus is conveniently calibrated with a beat- 
frequency oscillator. 

Coincident circuits. In cosmic-ray work especially, it is 
desirable to record only simultaneous discharges of two or 
more counters. Several means have been devised for ac- 
complishing this, but the one now in almost universal use 
is that of Rossi. 31 It may be applied to any number of 
counters. The circuit is shown in Fig. 21. The principle of 
operation is as follows: The plates of all tubes are con- 
nected in parallel across a high resistance Ri and a source 
of potential. The grid of each tube is normally at the same 
potential as the cathode, so that the drop in potential

across any one in the static condition is small compared with 
the drop across Jf? 4 . Under these conditions, if a negative 
pulse arrives at C\, tube Ti will instantaneously have a much 
higher resistance. However, since T% and T 3 are in parallel 
with Ti, there will be very little effect on the current through 
R iy and hence the drop in potential across R4, will be prac- 
tically unaltered. The same holds if two tubes are affected,

negative, the third one still has a low resistance compared 
with R iy and the resultant effect passed on through C 4 will 
still be small. However, if all three grids go more negative 
simultaneously, then the potential at C 4 rises, and a positive 
pulse is passed to the output. 

With the circuit constants given in Fig. 21 the direct- 
current resistance of each of the 57 or 6C6 tubes is 4000 ohms. 
The maximum possible voltage change to the output when 
one tube only receives a negative pulse is 0.8 volt, and when 
two tubes only are so affected, the maximum possible change 
is 2.8 volts. However, when the grids of all three tubes go 
negative simultaneously, the maximum change can be as

Ci, or of the grid potential on the first tube in the output, it 
is easy to rule out completely the singles and doubles and

High-voltage sources. Although batteries furnish an 
ideal source of high potential for counters, the expense in- 
volved usually prohibits their use. High-voltage direct- 
current generators can also be used, but the actual power 
required for the operation of a counter is so small that here 
again the expense is unjustified. The simplest and most 
practical method is to rectify alternating current after the 
potential has been increased with a transformer to the de- 
sired voltage, and then smooth the pulsating output with a 
condenser or, if much current is to be drawn, with one or 
more condensers and chokes. 

In most cases half -wave rectification is sufficient, since the 
actual current drain for a Geiger counter is usually small.

A simple, inexpensive rectifier is shown in Fig. 23, where a 
type 866 mercury-vapor tube 32 allows the condenser, C, to 
charge up to the peak voltage supplied by the transformer. 
It is necessary to have a filament transformer capable of 
withstanding the required potential if the negative side is 
grounded. The condenser C also has across it the full output 
potential. Its capacity need be no larger than 0.1 micro- 
farad if only current to supply the counter is drawn. The

with a suitable filter. 

where AV is the fluctuation in the voltage output, R the 
resistance across the output, and n the number of pulses 
supplied to the condenser, C, per second. 

In case it is desired to draw much current from the output, 
it is best to rectify both halves of the alternating-current 
wave. Two 866 tubes may be used as shown in Fig. 24. 
In this case a transformer with a center-tapped secondary 
winding and one insulated filament transformer are neces- 
sary. The filter consists of two condensers of capacity of 
1 to 2 microfarads and a 30-henry choke. The output of 
such a rectifier and filter unit will have less than a 1 per cent 
ripple for 60-cycle current when the current drain does not 
exceed 10 milliamperes. 

If a rectified voltage is wanted which is greater than the 
peak potential supplied by the transformer, a voltage- 
doubling circuit such as shown in Fig. 25 may be used. The

voltage output will be double the peak voltage available 
from the transformer. The circuit shown employs two 
type 866 mercury-vapor tubes. 

If it is desired to regulate the output voltage, a voltage 
regulator such as will be described later can be used. These 
devices will also take out the ripple, provided the minimum 
at any time does not fall below the stabilized voltage. 

Voltage regulators. Frequently it is desirable to maintain 
a constant voltage, for example, when working with a pro- 
portional Geiger counter. 
Several schemes 33 have been 
devised for accomplishing 
this, but one of the simplest 
is that shown in Fig. 26. The 
action is as follows: As the 
input potential is raised, no 
current flows through the 57, 
owing to the negative bias, 
until the output potential 
reaches a point where the 
grid is at about —3 volts 
with respect to the cathode. 
As the input potential is 
raised still farther, the out- 
put potential at first goes up 
slightly, and then, because of 
the drop in potential across 
Ri, reaches a maximum and 
finally falls. If g m is the mutual conductance of the tube, 
the change of output voltage V„ with input V t can be ex- 
pressed as

from 1500 to 2500 volts. Experimental results using the 
above circuit constants are shown in Fig. 27. As Ri is in- 
creased, the maximum becomes sharper and moves down to 
lower voltages. 

If it is desired to draw current from the output and still 
maintain a constant voltage supply, the above circuit is not 
satisfactory when more than a fraction of a milliampere of 
current is used. It is possible, by using the constant current 
characteristic of another pentode in conjunction with the 
above circuit, to keep a constant voltage output when the 
current is changed from to 1 milliampere.

[Chap. VII 



The circuit is shown in Fig. 28. The action may be de- 
scribed as follows: As the input voltage is raised, a point 
is reached where T x becomes conducting, depending upon the 
ratio of R 2 to R^. Until this time, T 2 has been in a highly 

conducting state, with a di- 
rect-current resistance prob- 
ably less than 1000 ohms, 
because of the +45 volts on 
the grid. As soon as Ti be- 
comes conducting, the drop 
in potential across R t be- 
comes approximately V 3 + S 
volts and tends to remain at 
this constant value. As the 
input voltage is still further 
raised, T 2 continues to carry 
current but acts as a con- 
stant current device, and the 
voltage is stabilized by the 
action of T h as in the previ- 
ous circuit. If now current 
is drawn from the output, 
the immediate tendency is 
for the grid of 7\ to go more 
negative with respect to the 
cathode. This makes J\ less 
conducting, resulting in a 
less negative potential on the 
grid of T 2 . Thus T 2 be- 
comes more conducting to 
supply the current delivered to the output. 

The performance of the circuit is illustrated in Fig. 29, 
where the circuit constants were those in Fig. 28 and 
Ri = 2 X 10 B ohms. The mutual interaction of the two 
tubes makes for a much more constant voltage regulation at 
all times than could be had with one tube. Experimentally 
there was less than 0.1 volt change in the output of 1039.5

voltage stabilization for current 
drains up to 1 milliampere. Drifts 
may be as low as 0.1 volt per hour in 
the output. Potentials from several 
hundred to several thousand volts

using the type 57 tubes.

volts when the input changed from 1050 to 2500 volts. A 
change from to 1 milliampere drain at any input voltage 
above the stabilized value changes the output voltage by 
less than 0.2 volt. When more current than this is drawn, 
the constant voltage characteristic of the circuit gradually 
disappears. 

None of the resistances or potentials in the circuit are 
critical except Vi and the ratio of R 2 to R 3 . For constancy, 
Ri and R s should be wire wound and kept at the same 
temperature. If Vi is supplied by new "B" batteries of the 
dry-cell type, very satisfactory results will be obtained,

since their temperature coefficient is exceedingly small. 
The heater supply of T 2 is not at all critical, and a change of 
50 per cent in the power input changes the output voltage of 
the circuit less than 0.1 volt. However, a change of 50 per 
cent in the power input to the heater of TV changes the out- 
put voltage by about 5 volts in 1000. Extended tests showed 
that after the first half hour, drifts may amount in the ex- 
treme cases to 1 volt per hour but may be as small as 0.1 volt 
per hour. 

It will be noted that the output voltage is within a few 
volts of the input voltage until the constant voltage region 



298 GEIGER COUNTERS [Chap. VII 

begins, and that thereafter the power dissipation is in a radio 
tube and not in resistances. By changing R 3 (Fig. 28) it is 
possible to achieve equal performance of the circuit from 
several hundred to several thousand volts. 

This type of constant voltage device is a valuable aid in 
eliminating the ripple from rectified alternating current. A 
condenser of low capacity can be used in the filter, and these 
circuits will take out the remainder of the ripple, provided the 
lowest potential reached is not below the stabilized voltage. 

Although the type 57 and similar tubes are rated by the 
manufacturer at about 250 volts on the plate, much higher 
voltages than this may be applied if the wattage dissipation 
is kept low. The limiting factor is usually sparking over in 
the base of the tube. Almost all of the tubes of this type 
will stand 2000 volts on the plate, and many of them will 
not break down under 4000 to 5000 volts. 

Discussion of probabilities and errors in Geiger counter 
work. Time between individual particles. If the particles 
are all independent of one another, they arrive at random, 
and the laws of probability can be applied. Assuming a 
constant source of radiation, the probability of finding a 
time interval between t and t + dt is given by 34 

P,dt = =e 'dt, (1) 

where t is the average value of the time interval. Then the 
probability of finding a time interval between h and t 2 is 
given by 

" P t dt = e ' - e "' . ( 2 ) 



I. 



In particular, if we want to know the probability of finding 
a time interval equal to or less than the average time inter- 
val t, we get (1 — 1/e) = 0.632, and the probability of 
finding a time interval between I and infinity is 0.368. In

Chap. VII] GEIGER COUNTERS 299 

the case of a mechanical recorder which will not respond to 
pulses separated by a time less than r, it is possible to find 
the average number of counts missed as follows: Let the 
average time between pulses, t, be large compared with t. 
Then Eq. 2 gives the probability of finding a time interval 
less than r. To the first order of approximation this 
probability is t/~L Thus, if N is the total number of par- 
ticles counted, the mean error in the count will be Nt/1, and 
the mean relative error will be r/t. 

Number of particles in a given time. If the number of 
particles from a constant source of radiation is counted for 
a certain length of time and compared with the number 
counted again for the same length of time, the two values 
will, in general, be different. The relative error of a single 
set of counts will, of course, decrease as the number of counts 
is increased. 

If n is the average number of particles arriving in a certain 
time, as determined by a long period of counting, and n is 
the actual number arriving in this time, the probability of 
finding this number n is given by Poisson's law 35 

P. = ^f- (3) 

n! 

Thus, if by counting a large number of particles, it is 
found that on the average there are 100 per minute from a 
certain source, then the probability that in this same time 
100 will actually be counted is 0.04, and the probability of 
50 being counted is only about 10~ 8 . There is a certain 
probability of any number being counted, but obviously 

£ p. = i. 



Error in a single count of n particles. If the mean or root 
mean square error, e m , is defined by 

CO 

« m 2 = J^(n - nfP n , 



36 Bateman, H., Phil. Mag., 20, 704 (1910). 



300 GEIGER COUNTERS [Chap. VII 

then application to Poisson's law gives 

e m = (n)>/ 2 , (4) 

and the probable error 36 is 0.67€ m = 0.67 n 1/2 , since for large 
values, n differs from n by only a small amount. The mean 
relative error, therefore, is e m /n, or n~ 1/2 . In order to have a 
probable error of 1 per cent in a single set of counts, it is, 
therefore, necessary to count 4300 particles; and to have a 
probable error of 0.1 per cent, 4.5 X 10 5 particles must be 
counted. 

Error introduced by background. If a single counter is 
used to measure the activity of a source of radiation which is 
comparable with the natural count of the counter due to 
background, it is important to know the effect of the back- 
ground upon the accuracy of the measurements. 

If the error of one set of counts is e h and the error in an- 
other set of counts is e 2 , then the error of the sum or difference 

Wil1 be e = (ex* + *«)!/*. (5) 

Consequently, if there are N\ counts due to a certain 
radiation plus the background and N 2 counts due to the 
background only, the mean error of the difference, which is 
the effect of the source being measured, is (Ni + iV 2 ) 1/2 , so 
that the relative mean error is (Ni + N 2 ) 1/2 /(Ni - N 2 ), 
and the relative probable error becomes 37 

" -u**&±^. (6) 



N 1 - N 2 (JVi - N 2 ) 

As an example, if the counting when the source to be meas- 
ured is present is twice what it is when only the background 
is being measured, then it is necessary to count 6 X 4500 = 
27,000 counts with the source present to reduce the probable 
error of the difference to 1 per cent. This is six times as 
many counts as would be needed if no background were 
present. The counting time will be three times as long. 

36 See any book on errors for the relation between mean and probable errors. 

37 See also Evans, R. D., and Mugele, R. A., Rev. Sci. Instruments, 7, 441 
(1936). 



Chap. VII] GEIGER COUNTERS 301 

In addition, half of this number must be counted when only 
the background is present, so that altogether 9 X 4500 = 
40,500 counts must be made, which will take six times as 
long as if there were no background. 

Errors due to accidentals in counting coincidences. If two 
counters are used to count coincidences between them, it 
will be found that even when the counters are separated by- 
great distances in a horizontal direction, so that cosmic rays 
do not contribute to the coincidences, there remains a back- 
ground of counts. These "accidentals" must usually be 
taken into account, especially when the real coincidences 
become of the same order of magnitude. 

In a coincidence circuit using two tubes, if a pulse arrives 
at one amplifying tube within a certain time r either before 
or after a similar pulse arrives at the other tube, where r is 
the resolving time, a coincidence will be recorded. There is 
a certain probability that two unrelated pulses will thus be 
recorded as a coincidence, which, of course, is spurious. 

Let the time widths of the pulses from each counter be 
equal. Then the resolving time will be defined as that time 
width of a pulse which will just respond as a coincidence 
when the peak of another similar pulse falls without a time 
2r of the first. 

Let there be an average of Ni pulses per second from one 
counter and an average of 1 per second from another counter. 
Then the probability that one will fall within a time width 
of one of the Ni pulses will be 2tN\, and if there are 2 per 
second on the average from the one counter, then the num- 
ber of accidentals will be 2(2rNi), and so forth; and for iV 2 
per second the number of accidentals will be on the average 

A a = 2rN 1 N i . (7) 

For the case of three counters connected to count triple 
coincidences, it is easily shown that the number of acci- 
dentals per second is given by 

A m = WNJiiNt, (8) 

when the counters are all separated in such a way that there 



302 GEIGER COUNTERS [Chap. VII 

are no real coincidences between any of the counters. The 
generalization of Eq. 8 for any number of counters n con- 
nected to count coincidences is 

A Xi . . .„ = nr-W", (9) 

where it is assumed that N and r are the same for all coun- 
ters. This last equation provides a ready means of deter- 
mining the resolving time of the counter circuit. It is 
necessary only to separate the counters in a horizontal plane 
to such distances that the number of real coincidences be- 
tween any two due to cosmic rays coming in near the horizon 
is small compared with the true accidentals, and to record 
the accidentals as well as the counting rate of one of the n 
similar counters. 

In case the t's and N's are all different, then, as 
Eckart and Shonka 38 have shown, the generalized expression 
becomes : 

An . . .„ = NiN 2 . . . N„tit2 . . .t„(- H )-...-)• 

Consistency of data. To check whether or not a counter 
set is operating properly, it is usually desirable to compute 
the probable error of the final result in two different ways. 
If these agree in general to within the required limits, then 
it may be assumed that the counters have been working 
consistently and that instrumental fluctuations have been 
negligible. 

Let the mean error in a single determination of Ni counts 
be ei, the mean error in another determination of Nz counts 
be e 2 , and so forth. Then by an extension of Eq. 5 the mean 
error of the result of n determinations is 

e m = («i 2 + e 2 2 -f . . . 6„2)i/2 ; 
or, by Eq. 4, 

e„ = (Ni + N 2 + . . . N n )^, 

and the probable error is 

€„ = 0.67(#i + N 2 + . . .Ag i/2 .

On the other hand, if Ni, Ni, and so forth, are taken over 
equal periods of time, the average value for this period of 
time will be 



N, + N 2 + 



N n 



Let the residuals (N - NJ, (N - N%), . . . (N - N n ) be 
denoted by r. Then the probable error of the result will be 



eJ = 0.67> 



/ 2r 2 y^ 2 
\n(n — 1)/ 



If there are instrumental fluctuations entering, then e/ is 
usually greater than e v . If e/ is approximately equal to 
e V) it can be safely assumed that the counters are working 
consistently, for there is an even chance that the actual error 
will be greater than that computed, 1 chance in 4.6 that it 
will be greater than twice that computed, and only 1 chance 
in 22 that it will be greater than three times that computed.

Numerical example. The data shown in Table I were 
found with two large G-M counters counting coincidences, 



304 GEIGER COUNTERS [Chap. VII 

by taking readings every hour with an automatic camera. 
The probable error computed from the residuals is therefore 

/ V r 2 v. 1/2 

«,' = 0.67(-7 -,-) =10.1, 



and the number of counts per hour with the probable error is 

3354.1 ± 10.1. 

Computed from the number of counts, the probable error 
in 67,083 is 0.67(67,083) 1/2 = 174, and the number of counts 
per hour with the probable error can be written 

3354.1 ± 8.7. 

It will be noticed that the probable errors computed in 
these two ways are nearly equal, although that computed 
from the residuals of each hourly reading is somewhat 
larger. However, there is no systematic trend in the data, 
there being nearly equal positive and negative residuals. 
An application of Chauvenet's 39 criterion to these data shows 
that a single residual must be larger than 150 in order to be 
rejected. No residual in the example should, therefore, be 
discarded. Consequently it may be concluded that there 
are no appreciable instrumental fluctuations entering into 
the result.
