CHAPTER XII 

Heat and High Temperature 

TN this chapter we will first consider some of the elemen- 
■*- tary aspects of the theory of heat transfer. Following 
this we will deal with various techniques of obtaining high 
temperatures, of temperature control, and of temperature 
measurement. 

Heat conduction. The steady state. The rate $ (ex- 
pressed in calories per second) at which heat flows across an 
isothermal surface element of area A, in a homogeneous 
medium, is proportional to A, to the conductivity of the 
material, K, and to the temperature gradient dT/dx per- 
pendicular to the surface, thus : 

dT 
<3? = — KA-t- calories/sec. (1) 

In the case of a rectangular parallelop'ped with opposite 
ends maintained at the temperatures T x and T%, Eq. 1, when 
integrated, becomes 

K A 

$ = - — (T, - TO calories/sec, (2) 

in which A is the cross-section area of the parallelopiped 
perpendicular to the temperature gradient and x is the sepa- 
ration between the isothermal surfaces 7\ and T 2 . Here K 
is assumed to be constant in the temperature range between 
T\ and 7V Values of the heat conductivity for various 
materials are given in Table I.

Shape factors. For many of the actual cases encountered, 
the geometry is not so simple as it is with the parallelopiped, 
and the integration of Eq. 1 may be quite difficult. Gener- 
ally, however, the integral may be expressed by an equation 

of the form 

$ = - KS(T 2 - TO calories/sec, (3) 

in which S, the so-called shape factor, depends upon the size 

and shape of the space between two isothermal surfaces 

maintained at temperatures T\ and TV 

For a rectangular parallelopiped the shape factor, from 

Eq. 2, is . 

8 = -• (4) 

x 

For two concentric cylindrical isothermal surfaces (long in 
comparison with their radii) of length I, maintained at 
temperatures T\ and T 2 , respectively, the value of S in terms 
of I and their radii n and r% is 

s = 2.731 
logi r 2 /ri 

For two concentric spherical isothermal surfaces, one of 
radius n at temperature T\ and the other of radius r 2 at 
temperature T 2 , the shape factor is 

8 = 7rn\- (6)

A heat problem which often arises in the laboratory 
requires the estimation of the heat loss of an electric furnace. 
The inner furnace wall, which is approximately at uniform 
temperature, is taken as one isothermal surface, and the 
outer surface of the furnace, at somewhat above room 
temperature, is taken as the other isothermal surface. Lang- 
muir, Adams, and Meikle have given shape factors for 
several special cases which may be applied to problems of 
this type. 1 However, to make an estimate of heat loss of a

cylindrical furnace, if the inner furnace tube is long and 
surrounded by a layer of insulating material as shown in 
Fig. 1, we may apply Eq. 5. Or, for the case shown in 

Fig. 2, we may apply Eq. 6, 
taking n and r 2 as the dimen- 
sions of the approximating 
spherical surfaces, indicated 
in the figure by dotted lines. 
These estimates are not ex- 
pected to be precise, but they 
are usually accurate enough to 
settle the questions which arise 
when one designs a furnace. 
The shape factor can also be determined experimentally, 
using the similarity between the law for the flow of heat, 
Eq. 1, and Ohm's law. The experimental determination of 
S is accomplished by measuring the electrical shape factor, 
S', for wooden models that simulate the inner and outer 
isothermal temperature surfaces of the heat problem in 
question. These model surfaces are coated with copper foil 
and serve as electrodes. The region between these surfaces 
is filled with a saturated solution of copper sulphate with 
\ per cent (by volume) sulphuric acid added. The con- 
ductance of this solution is deter- 
mined by applying alternating volt- 
age to the copper electrodes. Alternat- 
ing current is used to prevent polariza- 
tion at the electrodes. The equation 
giving the electrical shape factor is

V and i being the measured voltage 

drop and current. K', the electrical 

conductivity of the solution, may be 

determined by a separate experiment, using a box of cross 

section A' and length x' with copper end plates. For this 

box the shape factor is A'/x' (as in Eq. 4). To transform

was constructed. For example, if the model was made to 
half scale, S = 2S'. 

Heat conduction. The nonsteady state. The thermal 
behavior of a homogeneous body is described in a Cartesian 
system of coordinates by the following fundamental differ- 
ential equation: 

dT = K(d?T ,#T d?T\ 

di P c\dx 2 + dy 2 + dz 2 )' W 

Here t is the time, T is the temperature of a point in the 
body represented by the coordinates x, y, and z, dT/dt is the 
rate at which this temperature changes, and K, p, and c 
represent physical quantities for the material of which the 
body is composed, namely, the heat conductivity, density, 
and specific heat. The combination of these constants in 
the form h 2 = K/pc is convenient, h is called the thermal 
diffusivity of the material. 
In one dimension, Eq. 8 takes the form 

dT = K (PT_ , 

dt pc dx 2 

If dT/dt equals zero, and if we integrate d 2 T/dx 2 once, we 
get the equation which represents the steady-state problem : 

dT 

f = M. (!0) 

From physical considerations, the integration constant M 
is seen to have the meaning 

Af = - -jJti and $ = - KA 6 ^-, (11) 

KA dx 

which is the same as Eq. 1. 

A more general form of Eq. 8 includes an added term to 
take account of energy transformations associated with a 
change of state, and so forth, which will not be considered 
here. 

There are infinitely many solutions to the fundamental 
differential equation, Eq. 8. Those which are appropriate 



498 HEAT AND HIGH TEMPERATURE [Chap. XII 

for a given problem usually comprise an infinite series, the 
sum of which conforms to the requirements of the geometry 
of the body, and to the so-called boundary conditions set 
forth in the problem. The mathematical procedures in- 
volved in getting the series required for a particular problem 
were originally developed by Fourier over a hundred years 
ago; and these procedures have been extended by other 
mathematicians to include a great variety of more or less 
complicated cases. 2 Here, without taking up the mathe- 
matical procedures involved, we will discuss the results of 
their application to some typical heat problems. 3 

The infinite slab. First, let us determine the temperature 
at various points in a plane-parallel slab which, to start with, 
is at a uniform temperature T . We will find the tempera- 
ture at various places in the slab as a function of the time 
which elapses after the slab has been immersed into an 
environment maintained at a fixed temperature TV We 
will assume that T x is lower than T . (The changes required 
to apply the results so obtained for the opposite case, in 
which 7\ is higher than T , are obvious.) Practically, if the 
extension of the slab is great compared to its thickness, this 
becomes a one-dimensional problem, and to describe it we 
will take a Cartesian coordinate system which is oriented so 
that the faces of the slab coincide with the planes x — + x 
and — x . 

The solution of Eq. 8, which we want, is a series, the terms 
of which depend on both x and t. The sum of the series 
yields a uniform temperature throughout the slab at t = 0; 
and also at all times it gives a temperature gradient at the 
surfaces which conforms to the requirements of Newton's 
law of cooling. 

Newton's law of cooling states that the heat lost per unit

area of surface, W, by the slab to its environment, is propor- 
tional to the difference between the surface temperature T Xa 
and the temperature of the bulk of the medium in which it is 
immersed, TV 

W = N(T X0 - TO calories/sec./cm 2 . (12) 

W may be resolved into heat lost by radiation, TF rad ., and 
heat lost by convection, W conv . The temperature gradient 
at the surface is determined by the value of W and the 
thermal conductivity of the material of which the slab is 
composed. 

Stated algebraically, the boundary conditions which our 
solution of Eq. 8 must satisfy are 

at t = 0; T = T throughout the slab (13) 

and, for all values of t; 

at x = x g = - g(T„ - 7\) (14a) 

and also at

x= -x ^ = ^{T Xa - TO. (14b)

make the substitution, a

in the exponential terms, t is called the relaxation time. 
The reason for this will appear presently. 

At the beginning, that is, when t has small values com- 
pared with r, the accurate expression for T requires several 
terms of the series given by Eq. 15, in spite of the fact that 
the series is a rapidly converging one. However, soon after 
t = t, all the exponential terms become insignificant except 
the first one (n = 1). This is because a\ is smaller than 
the other values of a n . Soon after t = t, Eq. 15 reduces to 



T = Tx + -(To - TO 

IT 



. diir 

2 -" 2 ; 7T x 

— : e cos ai-— 



(19) 



The first factor in the brackets is a constant, the second deter- 
mines the decay of the temperature difference (T — Ti), 
and the third factor is the space distribution function for the 
temperature. The relaxation time is evidently the interval 
required for the temperature, initially uniform, to assume 
approximately the distribution given by the last factor in 
Eq. 19. 

The value of a\ for a body (with vertical sides) in air at 
room temperature is obtained from Eqs. 35, 48, 12, and 16: 

WW = 1.3 X 10-*(T ~ TJ calorie/sec./cm 2 . (35a) 

W mi = 1.5 X 10- 4 (T - T It ) calorie/sec./cm 2 . (48a) 

Thus 

N = 2.8 X 10- 4 calorie/sec./cm7°C. 

To illustrate how Eq. 19 may be applied, let us consider 
the case of a telescope mirror of 2 cm thickness which is to be 
tested by the Foucault knife-edge test. For a reliable test, 
if this mirror is brought from a room in which it is either 
warmer or cooler than the air of the testing room, it will be 
necessary to wait until the mirror has adjusted itself to the 
new temperature. If the glass is 15 cm or more in diameter 
and is exposed to the room air on both sides, we may regard 
it as an infinite slab and apply Eq. 19 to determine its thermal 



Chap. XII] HEAT AND HIGH TEMPERATURE 501 

behavior. For the glass we may take K = .0024 and h 2 = 
.0057. This gives r = 71 seconds, and by means of Eq. 16, 
we get ai = 0.219. 

Substituting this value of ai, Eq. 19 can be written in the 
form 

lpg 10 (^^^) = - 3 X 10-H + 0.15 + log 10 (cos 0.34s). (20) 

This solution is valid after more than 71 seconds have 
elapsed. To get the thermal behavior at the start, the 
logarithm of (TV — T x )/(Ti — T ) can be plotted as ordinate 
against t as abscissa. The series of parallel straight lines 
obtained for t > 71 seconds are then extrapolated to the 
common point where the abscissa and the ordinate are equal 
to zero, bearing in mind that T x=±x , changes rapidly with 
time when t = and T x=0 changes very slowly. This method 
is not very precise, and a more exact solution is to be ob- 
tained from Eq. 15. This formula is rather difficult to 
manage, except in special cases. Two of these are treated 
below. 

Eq. 15 can be simplified for the extreme cases of relatively 
fast cooling, where NxJ K> > 1, and relatively slow cooling, 
where Nx / K < < 1. In the first case a„ is approximately 
(2n 4-1), sin(a„7r/2) is ( — 1)", and the expression for temper- 
ature simplifies to 

T-n + ^To-TOp^e * cos(2n+l)g. (21) 



For slow cooling, where Nx / K < < 1, the slab is practically 
isothermal, and the temperature is given by 

T = Ti. + (T a - rOe^'. (22) 

The solution of problems of this character will be useful 
to the experimenter when he encounters questions of design 
involving the accommodation of objects to changes of 
temperature. 



502 HEAT AND HIGH TEMPERATURE [Chap. XII 

The application to optical testing has already been dis- 
cussed. In optical testing with the Foucault knife-edge 
test, lack of thermal equilibrium distorts the figure of an 
optical surface and gives rise to troublesome convection 
currents. 

The relaxation time. The relaxation time for a cylinder is 
approximately half that for a slab, when 2x Q , the thickness of 
the slab, and 2r , the diameter of the cylinder, are equal. 
The relaxation time for a sphere or cube is approximately 
one quarter of that for a corresponding slab. In most of the 
nonsteady-state problems encountered, it is sufficient to know 
the relaxation time. The relaxation time can be interpreted 
as the time for a heat pulse to travel into the center of the 
slab, a distance x . The relaxation times are given in 
Table I for a slab thickness of 2 cm (x = 1 cm) for different 
materials. It must be remembered that for different values 
of x the time required for the heat to penetrate to the 
center of the slab is proportional to x 2 . 

The relaxation time for graphite, which is approximately 
the same as that for copper, is especially noteworthy. The 
extreme values for r given in Table I are about J second and 
404 seconds for silver and paraffin respectively. 

Periodic temperatures. Let us consider a slab of thickness 
x having a harmonic surface temperature T x — A cos wt.

The product wt is the ratio of the relaxation time to the 
period of the impressed harmonic temperature multiplied by 
2ir. If wt is small, the plate follows the impressed tempera- 
ture closely with an out-of-phase component, sin at, propor- 
tional to ojt, and the amplitude of the temperature fluctua- 
tion is proportional to cos (tx/2x ). 

When cor > > 1, the temperature near the surface is 
approximately the same as if the slab were infinitely thick, 
while the temperature in the center is practically constant. 

The temperature at a distance x from the surface of an 
infinitely thick slab is given, after a long time, by the ex-

Heat transfer by free convection. Except for a few 
special cases, the estimation of heat loss by free convection 
is quite complicated or even impossible. The special cases 
which have been solved include plane surfaces and wires 
cooled by convection. The work on this subject up to 1933 
has been summarized by W. J. King. 4 Among the various 
methods for calculating convection losses, that of Langmuir 
is the simplest. 5 His method applies when the surfaces are 
small, such as those encountered in the laboratory. As it

Here K is the thermal conductivity for air, T t is the absolute 
temperature of the vertical surface, and T 2 is the ambient 
temperature. A more complete theory shows that W is 
proportional to (T 2 — T^) wi and to the fourth root of the 
height of the vertical surface. K, in Eq. 35, is not in- 
dependent of temperature, and, except for small temperature 
drops, the heat transfer is given by the expression

Langmuir found that heat losses by free convection from a 
horizontal surface facing upward are 10 per cent greater than 
they are from a vertical surface, and they are 50 per cent less 
from a surface facing downward than they are from a vertical 
surface. 

The procedure for calculating the convection losses from 
wires is also treated by Langmuir. 

Heat transfer by radiation. The energy emitted by a sur- 
face of area A radiating the heat spectrum between the wave 
lengths X and X + d\ is 

$d\ = TT€\J\d\ calories/sec. (38) 

This represents the summation of energy in respect to the 
solid angle over the hemisphere (angle 2ir steradians). Here 
e x is the emissivity of the surface. This is the ratio of the 
emission of the surface to that which would obtain for a 
"black body" at the same temperature. J x is the energy 
radiated per unit solid angle by a black body of the same 
area at wave length X for a unit wave-length range, dX = 1 cm. 

So-called black-body radiation is defined as the thermal 
radiation coming from the surface of a body which is in 
temperature equilibrium with all of its surroundings. For 
example, the inner surface of a cavity in an opaque material 
at a uniform temperature emits black-body radiation. In 
fact, black-body radiation is obtained experimentally from 
just such a cavity. The wall of the cavity is pierced to 
form a small aperture to serve as an outlet for the radiation, 
the hole being small enough not to disturb the equilibrium 
perceptibly. The name black-body radiation comes indirectly 
from Kirchoff's law, which states that the emission and 
absorption coefficients of any body are equal. A black body 
with an absorption coefficient of unity, a x = 1, therefore, by 
Kirchoff's law, has an emission coefficient of unity, e x = 1. 

The Planck expression for J x is a function of the wave 
length, X, and the absolute temperature, T.

This formula describes the distribution of energy in the heat 
spectrum, and its plot against X at different temperatures is 
illustrated in Fig. 3. 

For XT = 0.3 this expression is approximated to within 
1 per cent by the so-called Wiens formula, 



Ji = -vr-e 



calories/sec. /cm/steradian. 



(40) 



As XT' becomes << 0.3, Ji becomes asymptotic to / x - 

For XT = 80 the expression is approximated to within 
1 per cent by the so-called Rayleigh-Jeans formula,

(41) 



As XT' becomes » 80, J I becomes asymptotic to J x . 
The values of the constants Ci and c 2 , where X is expressed in 
centimeters, are Ci = 2.81 X 10 -13 calorie/sec./cm 2 /unit solid 
angle; and c 2 = 1.432 X 10 8 cm degrees. 

The total heat lost by a unit area of the surface of a "black 
body" is the quantity expressed by Eq. 38 integrated over all 
wave lengths. This gives Stefan's formula: 

$ = TrfJxdX = AaT" calories/sec. (42) 

Most surfaces have a total emission which may be ex- 
pressed as 

$ = At T crT i calories/sec. (43)

Here a has the value of 1.37 X 10 -12 calorie/sec. /cm 2 /

The heat emitted by a flat surface of area A into a cone 
which is defined by a solid angle dQ, is 



rf$ = A cos 6 — treT* calories/sec. 



(44) 



Here A cos 6 is the projected area of the source and dQ/ir is 
the fraction of the total heat emitted in the direction 6 
defined by the element dtt. 

e T is an emissivity averaged over all wave lengths, and it 
is ordinarily "constant" only for a small temperature range. 
For porous nonmetallic substances it is very nearly unity, 
regardless of the color of the material. Naturally, the visible 
color of a body does not determine its infrared "color." 
Some bodies, such as white lead, are almost completely black 
throughout the heat spectrum, while the reverse is true for 
other substances, notably soot and black paper, both of 
which are transparent for the long wave-length end of the 
heat spectrum. e T for aluminum paints, around room tem- 
perature, varies between 0.3 and 0.5. For nonmetallic pig- 
ment paints e T = 1. 

For clean metals, e T varies with the temperature in such 
a way that the total emissivity is conveniently represented 
by an expression of the form 

$ = AMT m calories/sec. (45) 

Here M and m are constants. Values of M and m for some 
common metals are given in Table III.

510 HEAT AND HIGH TEMPERATURE [Chap. XII 

The heat transfer by radiation between two parallel black 
isothermal surfaces of area A at absolute temperatures 7\ 
and Ti, which are separated by a small distance, is 

W = o-(7y - TV) calories/sec./cm 2 (46) 

W = L37 {(lMo) 4 " (iSo) 4 } calories/sec/cm*. (47) 

If the temperature difference, (T 2 — 7\), is small, this 
heat transfer may be expressed so : 

W = 5.5 X 10~ 12 T 3 AT calories/sec./cm 2 . (48) 

Thus, owing to the fact that the absolute temperature 
enters the expression to the third power, we see that the 
importance of radiation as an agency for heat transfer be- 
comes greater at higher temperatures, until finally, in com- 
parison, ordinary conduction becomes negligible. 

At extremely high temperatures, the action of an in- 
sulator is the same as the action of a radiation baffle or series 
of baffles. The effect of baffles can be illustrated by the 
example of two infinite plane-parallel black surfaces at tem- 
perature Ti and T 2 . If a thin black baffle is interposed 
between these two surfaces, the transfer by radiation is 
reduced to one-half its original value. Two baffles reduce it 
to one-third, three baffles to one-fourth, and so forth, and if, 
instead of black baffles, polished metal reflectors are used, 
the insulation effect is even greater. In high-temperature 
furnaces the furnace tube with its winding is frequently 
surrounded by a thin sheet of some metal like molybdenum 
to serve as a baffle to reflect back most of the radiant energy 
emitted by the tube and so to decrease the power required. 
Sometimes, too, a second refractory furnace tube may sur- 
round the first to act as an insulator. 

Low temperatures. Moderately low temperatures are 
obtained in the laboratory by immersion in baths of ice, salt 
and ice, dry ice, liquid air, and so forth. The various tem- 
peratures so attained are listed in Table IV. For obtaining

Fig. 5 illustrates the ordinary Bunsen burner. The 

Bunsen burner is simply a tube 
arranged with a fuel gas jet in 
the bottom and air ports in the 
sides near the bottom. It draws 
air in through these ports by in- 
jector action of the gas jet. The 
air drawn into the tube at the 
bottom is mixed with the fuel 
gas as it passes up through the 
tube; and above the top of the 
tube this air reacts chemically 
with the gas fuel to produce the 
flame. 

The Bunsen burner draws 
only about half as much oxygen 

through its ports as is required for burning the fuel. If 

more air were mixed with the 

gas, the velocity of propagation 

of the flame would be greater 

than the upward velocity of the 

gas in the tube, and the flame 

would "backfire." However, 

additional air required for com- 
bustion of the gas is supplied to 

the flame above the burner tube; 

owing to the more abundant 

supply of air, at the edges of the 

flame the propagation velocity 

is greater than the upward ve- 
locity of the gas, so that the 

fire does not blow itself out. 
Natural gas, which contains 

less hydrogen than coal gas, has 

a much smaller flame velocity.

are shown in Table V.) Accordingly, with natural gas there 
is a greater tendency of the burner to blow out than with coal 
gas. This has resulted in the invention of fixtures like those 
shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c), which serve to retard the upward 
velocity of a portion of 

the gas mixture. The I Hi lewc. /j)|ff|__ 15W c. 

flame formed by this 
slowed-up portion does 
not blow out, and it pre- 
vents the main flame 
from doing so. A small 
tube may be soldered to 
the burner as shown in 
Fig. 5 at (a) to act as a 
pilot as well as to pre- 
vent the flame from blow- 
ing out. 

The Meker burner is a 
Bunsen-type burner with 
the top of the burner tube 
flared out and fitted with 
a nickel grill. This is illus- 
trated in Fig. 6. The 
Meker burner can burn 
coal gas with a higher air admixture than the Bunsen burner, 
because the grill, acting as a Davy lamp screen, prevents

flame which is both hotter and more uniform over an ex- 
tended area than the Bunsen flame. The temperature dis- 
tributions in the Bunsen and Meker flames, with coal gas 
fuel, are shown in Fig. 7. 

To obtain a higher temperature than either the Bunsen or

Extremely high temperatures are attained -with oxy-

otherwise the torches would blow themselves out. The type 
of orifice used is illustrated in Fig. 13. Fig. 14 shows the 

distribution of temperature 
in the oxyacetylene flame 
and also in the carbon arc. 8 
A furnace is required to 
heat objects to higher tem- 
peratures than those that are 
obtainable with torches. Gas 
furnaces for use in the labo- 
ratory are shown in Figs. 15 
and 16. 

Oxygen-gas furnaces can 
be made to yield very high 
temperatures; for example, 
Podszus and von Warten- 
burg, Linde, and Jung have 
described furnaces with a zir- 
conium dioxide tube using 
illuminating gas or oil vapor 
as fuel. 9 These furnaces at- 
tain temperatures of about 
2600°C. 10 

Electric furnaces. Electric furnaces for temperatures to 
500°C, useful for such applications as the baking out of 
charcoal traps, can be made by winding a coil of Nichrome 
or Chromel wire on an iron tube as shown in Fig. 17. The

types of insulation may be used. For example, the inner 
tube and its resistance wire winding may be covered with 
several layers of asbestos. The furnace is assembled with 
transite 11 ends, using Insa-lute cement. It is necessary to 
avoid contact between the 
Insa-lute cement and the fur- 
nace wire at elevated temper- 
atures. 

Nickel wire is suitable for a 
furnace winding. However, 
its resistance changes ap- 
proximately twofold when it 
is heated from room tempera- 
ture to 500 °C. This behavior 
is in contrast to the behavior 
of the nickel-chromium alloys,

whose change of resistance is negligible. The change of 
resistance of nickel may or may not be desirable; it may be 

desirable to have a large co- 
efficient if the resistance is to 
be used for regulating the 
temperature of the furnace. 

Electric furnaces which 
operate in air to 1100°C. 
may be made with the nickel- 
chrome alloys as resistors, a 
porcelain, Alundum, quartz, 
or magnesia tube being used 
to support the winding. Di- 
atomaceous earth makes an 
excellent insulator. 12 A use- 
ful furnace construction for 
the laboratory is illustrated 
in Fig. 19. 

Platinum may be used as resistor for temperatures greater 
than 1100°C., when it is desired to have the furnace operate 
in air. This resistor will operate up to a temperature limit of 
1600°C In order to obtain a furnace temperature as near 
this limit as possible, Orton and Krehbiel used a Chromel 
"booster" winding on a tube 
mounted outside of and con- 
centric with the platinum 
winding. 13 The platinum wire 
may be wound on quartz glass, 
which has a temperature limit 
in air of 1300 °C, on unglazed 
porcelain, for which the limit 
is 1400°C, or on clay, with 
a limit of 1700°C. However,

best of all is an Alundum tube (alumina with clay binder). 
Its limit, 1900°C, is above that of the platinum. 

Silicon is formed from 
quartz or porcelain in a SiH? ~ Cel brJcX - 
reducing atmosphere, and 
silicon attacks platinum. 
Accordingly, it is best to use 
a platinum-wound furnace in 
an oxidizing atmosphere. 
If, however, the wire is 
wound on an Alundum tube, 
it may be operated in a re- 
ducing atmosphere. 

Molybdenum or tungsten can be used as a resistor in an 
atmosphere of hydrogen; the limiting temperatures attain- 
able are 2200 °C. and 3000 °C. respectively. As a support 
for the resistor winding, Alundum can be used to 1900°C, 
magnesia to 2200°C, zirconia to 2500°C, and thoria to

Fixed temperatures. Constant temperature may be 
maintained at 0°C. with melting ice, and at the boiling 
temperature of water by means of a device such as the one 
illustrated in Fig. 25. Other liquids and solids may be used 
for maintaining other constant temperatures; for example, 
a temperature of 444.6°C. is obtained by boiling sulphur. 
Some of the fixed temperatures useful for the calibration of 
thermometers and thermocouples are given in Table VI.

ever, the principle on which they operate is the same, namely, 
the balancing of the heat input to the furnace against its 
heat losses. The heat input is controlled by a pilot indicator 
which is continually kept oscillating about a mean position 
corresponding to the desired temperature. When it is on 
either one or the other side of the mean position, it modulates 
the heat input: When the pilot indicates the temperature 
low, the heat input is automatically increased, and when it 
indicates high, the heat input is diminished. In this sense 
one does not maintain a constant temperature but a periodic 
one which varies between more or less fixed limits about a 
mean temperature. 

As an example of a temperature-regulating device, let us 
consider a furnace with its winding made one arm of a self- 
balancing Wheatstone bridge, the bridge current in this arm 
serving at the same time as furnace heating current. The 
furnace winding must be made of nickel, molybdenum, 
tungsten, or platinum for this type of regulator, since the 
nickel-chromium alloys do not have a suitable temperature 
coefficient of resistance. The other resistances in the 
Wheatstone bridge may be rheostats made from a low- 
temperature-coefficient alloy such as constantan. The 
bridge galvanometer serves as the pilot to control the heating 
current. 

Let us compare this method with one which employs a 
thermocouple inside the furnace as a pilot. We see that 
there will be more lag between the time the heat input is 
altered and the time it affects the thermopile. As a result, 
with the thermocouple pilot the limits of the fluctuation of 
the furnace temperature are separated more than they are 
when the resistance of the heater wire serves as the pilot. 

Even when the furnace heater wire serves as the pilot, 
there are fluctuations due to the period of auxiliary instru- 
ments. These temperature fluctuations may be diminished 
simply by interposing alternate shells of thermal "ballast" 
and insulator between the furnace winding and the region 
that is to be kept at a constant temperature. The tempera-

ture diffusion through such alternate shells is slow. The 
furnace tube itself, which separates the heater wires from 
the constant temperature region within, is usually adequate 
for this, because of its relatively low diffusivity, h; for 
example, one may obtain temperatures constant to about

0.01 °C. inside the furnace tube even when the period of 
temperature oscillation of the furnace wiring outside is of the 
order of 30 seconds. 

The device shown in Fig. 26 is convenient for temperature 
regulation. 18 The two bulbs of this device have equal 
volumes, and they are equipped with identical nickel-

chromium alloy heaters and connected electrically as shown 
in the diagram, Fig. 27. The bulbs are filled with air and 
the pressures on either side of the mercury column are such 
as to hold the top surface of the mercury at the level of the 

tungsten contact when the

voltage drop over the left 
resistance (see Fig. 26) is 
the same as the voltage 
drop over the right re- 
sistance. These voltage 
drops are equal when the 
temperature-sensitive feeler 
resistance is the same as 
the fixed constantan re- 
sistance. (See Fig. 27.) 
These resistances are ad- 
justed to be equal at the 
desired temperature. If the 
temperature of the feeler re- 
sistance is too high or too 
low, the heating in the two 
bulbs is unequal, and the 
resulting change in pressure 
in the bulbs opens or closes 
the mercury contact, and 
this in turn operates a relay 
actuating the heating and 
bridge current. 19 

The resistance used to op- 
erate the regulating device 
may be either the heater resistance or it may be separate from 
the heater. In the latter case this arrangement is suitable for 
maintaining a constant temperature in a room. The feeler 
resistance is strung back and forth near the ceiling of the

room (at about 8 feet above the floor). For such an appli- 
cation the heaters, which the regulating device controls, are 
situated in front of the ventilator 
air inlet to the room. 

Thermostat baths use water for 
ordinary temperatures, oil or eutec- 
tic salt mixtures for elevated tem- 
peratures, and alcohol for low tem- 
peratures. Beattie gives the compo- 
sition of two eutectic baths. (See 
Table VII.) These baths are useful 
in the temperature range above 
120°C. The lower limits of their tem- 
perature ranges overlap the upper 
temperature limits of mineral-oil 
baths (150° to 200°C.) and heavy 
cylinder oil baths (150° to 300°C). 

The temperature of a water bath 
is controlled by regulating the heat 
input. A mercury-in-glass bulb 
with contacts coupled to a relay 
as shown in Fig. 18, Chapter X, is 
suitable for a bath heated elec- 
trically. The device shown in 
Fig. 28 is effective for controlling 
the temperature of a gas-heated Fig. 28. After W. Ostwald.

bath. The aperture through which the gas for the flame 
passes is regulated by the thermal expansion and contraction 
of the mercury. With these devices the fluctuations of the 
bath are about 0.1 °C. 

Temperature measurement. Temperature is always 
measured practically by a measurement of some temperature- 
sensitive property, such as light emission, electrical resist- 
ance, length, volume, thermal e.m.f., and so forth. All 
physical properties which vary with temperature are possi- 
bilities for such a measurement, although some properties, 
like electron emission, are so strongly influenced by chemical 
impurities or by the past physical history of the thermo- 
metric substance that they are useless. 

Liquid-in-a-bulb thermometers depend upon change of 
volume with temperature for their readings. Among them, 
two are of unusual interest. One, which was manufactured 
in Germany at one time, used gallium as liquid and fused 
quartz for the bulb and capillary. This thermometer was 
useful up to a temperature of about 1000°C, in contrast to 
the mercury thermometer, which is ordinarily useful only to 
200 °C. However, with a high pressure of nitrogen (up to 
40 atmospheres) mercury-in-glass thermometers may be 
heated considerably above 200°C. A graphite thermometer 
with molten tin as the liquid has been made by Northrup. 20 
This thermometer may be used to 1680° without chemical 
reaction between the tin and the graphite. As tin does not 
boil at 1680°C, Northrup thinks that the limit in tempera- 
ture of this thermometer is probably several hundred degrees 
higher. The position of the tin in the graphite capillary is 
determined by a tungsten feeler. For gallium the tempera- 
ture range from the melting point to the boiling point is from 
29.7° to 1600°C, and for tin it is from 231.8° to 2260°C. 
The operation of the two thermometers described above 
depends upon these unusually long temperature intervals 
between the melting points and boiling points.

Thermocouples operate by virtue of the temperature 
dependence of the thermal e.m.f. generated by two sub- 
stances in contact. The thermocouple may be employed in 
the laboratory for temperature measurement from liquid air 
temperatures to the melting temperature of molybdenum.

The base metals commercially available are commonly 
used as thermoelectric wires. Chromel-Alumel wires have a 
high coefficient of thermal e.m.f. They are obtainable from 
the factory matched to give the temperature to ± 5°C. 
Copper and constantan wires also have a high thermal e.m.f. 
These wires have the advantage over Chromel-Alumel that 
they are easily soldered. The LeChatelier combination 
(platinum and 10 per cent platinum-rhodium) is used for 
precision measurements. Special thermocouple metals, such 
as tungsten, molybdenum, and their alloys, are useful at very 
high temperatures. 

It may be desired to calibrate a particular thermocouple 
with fixed standard-temperature baths such as those listed 
above in Table VI. The best procedure is to use the cali- 
bration curve supplied by the factory, which gives the e.m.f. 
at frequent temperature intervals, and to plot an empirical 
correction curve for it from the calibration data. 

Radiation pyrometers determine temperature by the 
measurement of light emission. There are several types, and 
descriptions of them and their operating characteristics 
appear in many books. The type in most common use 
measures, with a special photometer, the intensity of mono- 
chromatic light (6600 A) emitted by the incandescent body 
whose temperature is being measured. 

Table VIII is useful for estimating the temperature of a 
body from its color.
