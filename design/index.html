CHAPTER XIV 

Notes on the Construction and Design of 
Instruments and Apparatus 

The cutting of metals. In essence, the cutting of metal 
in the lathe, the milling machine, and so forth, amounts 
to the continuous driving of a hard-metal wedge, the tool, 
under the surface layer of the work. Fig. 1 illustrates a 
typical tool. In the lathe the work moves and the tool is 
stationary, while in the milling machine the opposite is the 
case. This difference, however, is immaterial. The impor- 
tant factors are the cutting angle, the rake, the clearance, 
and the speed and feed with which the cutting operation is 
carried out. 

The cutting angle is illustrated in Fig. 1. For hard and 
brittle metals it is best to have this angle large; for soft

tenacious metals it is best to have the cutting angle small. 
For example, the cutting angle usually varies from 75° for 
brass and cast iron to 40° for steel and even less for copper

and aluminum. Thin, keen tools with a small cutting angle 
will not stand up under severe cutting conditions as well as 
the blunt ones, because the blunt tools conduct heat away 
from the tip more effectively. 

The rake angle is illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. The dimen- 
sion of the rake angle determines the amount of deformation 
or cold working of the metal chip removed. This cold work- 
ing is diminished, and the heat generation is also diminished 
when the rake angle is increased. With large rake angles the 
forces acting between the chip, or turning, and the tool are 
more tangential than normal. It is desirable to diminish 
normal forces when cutting soft tenacious metals which tend 





Fig. 2. 

to stick to the tool. For brass, the rake angle should be nearly 
zero — it may be even a little less than zero. (See Fig. 2.) 

In the lathe the clearance angle is the angle included 
between the inner surface of the tool and the direction of 
relative motion at the tip of the tool. (See Fig. 1.) It is 
important, especially for boring, to have this angle great 
enough to prevent the heel of the tool from riding on the 
work. Clearance angles vary from 35° for soft tenacious 
metals to 10° for cast iron and brass. 

The higher speeds of the lathe should be used for cutting 
brass except when turning castings or using the cutting-off 
tool. Unless the proper speed is used with the cutting-off 
tool, it will chatter. The proper speed and feed for this tool 
depends upon the size of the work, but in general these

factors are to be determined by trial. A wooden plug 
inserted in a tube lessens chattering when the cutting-off 
tool is used. Fig. 3 shows a method of shaping a cutting-off 
tool which minimizes chattering. In this 
tool, side rake is balanced against asym- 
metry of the end so that the tool cuts 
squarely into the material. The point of 
the tool is ground on the side of the tool 
adjacent to the piece on which a finished 
edge is desired. The other piece may exhibit 
a slight burr. 

For cutting steel, the speed should be as 
fast as the tool will stand without burning. 
For final cuts, however, a moderate speed 
gives a better finish. 

Tools with a round nose give smooth finish cuts. Fig. 4 
shows such a tool having about 10° clearance for cutting 
either brass or cast iron. The tool shown here has a slight 
double side rake, and it will cut in the direction of either the 
headstock or the tailstock. 

The function of a lubricant in cutting metals is in most 
cases primarily to cool the chip and tool to 
prevent sticking. Brass, bronze, and cast 
iron may be machined dry (except in the 
operations of tapping, knurling, and polish- 
ing, for which machine oil is used). 
Soluble oil or lard oil is used for tenacious 
metals such as steel. Kerosene or turpen- 
tine is often used for aluminum. Milk 
may be used for copper. Lead and babbitt 
are turned dry, but they are oiled for filing, 
drilling, and threading. 
The lathe is by far the most versatile machine 
It can accomplish nearly all the operations 
that are done on other machines, such as the miller, the 
shaper, the grinder, the drill press, and so forth, besides the

572 CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN [Chap. XIV 

many operations which it alone can do. For this reason it 
seems right that we should devote some space to a discussion 
of its properties. 

The essential parts of the lathe are the spindle, tailstock, 
saddle (or carriage), ways, slide rest, and compound rest. 
The spindle is supplied with power and rotates in close- 
fitting bearings, which constrain it to turn on a single fixed 
axis. The tailstock is a socket, the axis of which is supposed 
to coincide with the axis of rotation of the spindle. It is 
mounted on guides in the ways so that its distance from the 
end of the spindle may be fixed to suit the work at hand. 
The saddle, or carriage, is used primarily to support a cutting 
tool and to allow it motion parallel to the axis of rotation of 
the work. The ways are metal guides on which the carriage 
and tailstock move. They are formed on the bed, or frame- 
work of the lathe, and are supposed to be parallel to the axis 
of the spindle. The slide rest consists of ways with a slide. 
Its ways are supposed to be perpendicular to the axis of 
rotation. It is mounted on the saddle, and serves to adjust 
the distance of the tool from the axis of the spindle. The 
compound rest also consists of a set of ways with a slide. It 
is mounted on the slide rest and can be adjusted to move the 
tool that it carries in any horizontal direction with respect 
to the axis of the spindle. 

Lathes are usually equipped with two chucks, one with 
three jaws and the other with four. In the three-jawed 
chuck the jaws are moved by the rotation of a spiral or scroll 
within the body of the chuck. This system is mechanically 
very poor. The jaws never approach the center at the same 
rate. As a consequence, round objects mounted in it are 
seldom accurately centered. If the chuck will center work 
within 0.003 of an inch, it is about all that can be expected. 
The three-jawed chuck is good only for work in which all 
the surfaces are to be turned at one setting, the work then 
being cut off. Once the work is removed from the chuck, 
it is practically impossible to replace it concentric with 
the surfaces already done. 



Chap. XIV] CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN 573 

In the four-jawed chuck the jaws are capable of inde- 
pendent adjustment. Therefore the accuracy of the center- 
ing of the work in a four-jawed chuck will depend upon the 
skill of the mechanic. With a dial indicator, and a little 
practice, work can be centered within 0.0002 of an inch in 
5 or 10 minutes. The four-jawed chuck can also be used for 
holding eccentric or irregular work. 

A dial indicator is a measuring device which can be 
mounted on the tool post in such a way that a projecting 
lever or plunger will bear against the work as it turns. The 
dial then indicates the eccentricity of the work directly in 
thousandths of an inch. It can be supplied with attach- 
ments for reaching into holes. It is sometimes desirable, 
however, to center a piece of work on a prick-punch mark. 
In this case a pencil with a rubber eraser in its end may be 
used. The tip is inserted in the prick-punch mark, and the 
eraser is placed in the tailstock. The indicator is then 
placed to bear against the pencil, and as the work is rotated, 
it shows the eccentricity of the punch mark. 

The primary operation which a lathe can perform is to 
execute a truly circular cut on a piece of material. This 
operation is accomplished by mounting the work directly on 
the spindle, or by mounting it between the spindle and the 
fixed bearing in the tailstock, so that it can be rotated 
against the tool. The perfection of roundness of the work 
depends in either case upon the perfection of the spindle 
bearings. If the spindle wabbles, the tool cut is, of course, 
not true. 

The tool is mounted so that it can be moved in a horizontal 
plane passing nearly through the rotation axis. As the 
work rotates, the moving tool makes a continuum of circular 
cuts. These generate, in general, a conical surface. Of the 
possible cones two are of special interest in machine work: 
one, that of zero taper, is the cylinder, and the other, that of 
infinite taper, is the flat surface produced by a facing cut. 
All others come under the head of taper cutting. 

Generation of a cylindrical surface is possible if the tool 



574 CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN [Chap. XIV 

moves truly parallel to the axis of rotation of the work. In 
practice this is never the case, although in good lathes the 
error is usually negligible. When the work is mounted on 
the spindle, this parallel motion of the tool in respect to the 
axis is possible only if the ways of the carriage are parallel to 
the spindle, and if the ways themselves are straight. They 
are usually quite straight in the horizontal sense, but in the 
vertical sense the wearing of the ways tends to make them 
concave, with the result that the carriage moves up and down 
as it travels. For this reason it is always desirable to have 
the tip of the tool at the same height from the ways as the 
axis of rotation, for the error introduced by its up and down 
motion is then minimized. 

If the work is mounted on dead centers, that is, if it is 
supported on conical points between the spindle and the 
tailstock and is turned by a dog bearing on the face plate, 
then truth of the work depends upon parallelism of the ways 
to a line between the two points, or centers. The tailstock 
is usually in error. It may be out of line laterally, a fault 
that one can usually correct by taking a trial cut, measuring 
the two ends, and setting the tailstock over again, using the 
adjusting screws which are usually provided. If the tail- 
stock center is too high or too low, there is little to be done 
except to keep the tool at the average height of the two 
centers, thus minimizing the errors. Sometimes the ram, or 
plunger, in the tailstock which carries the center does not 
move parallel to the axis of the spindle. Thus, it may be 
well centered when the ram is retracted but not when the 
ram is extended. Sometimes the tip of the dead center, 
that is, the center in the tailstock, is bent or worn, in which 
case the remedy is obvious. If the live center, the one in the 
spindle, is untrue, it makes no difference unless the work is 
to be reversed and further machined. The live center is 
usually of soft steel, and for nice work it is common practice 
to true it by turning down its tip before mounting the work. 

One way to turn a cylinder of uniform diameter is to lash 
the work to the face plate with thongs and to support it 



Chap. XIV] CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN 575 

with a follower rest mounted on the carriage directly oppo- 
site the tool. This practice will insure uniformity of diam- 
eter but will not insure the straightness of the work. Some- 
times in machining slender objects, one end of the work is 
held in a chuck while the other end is supported by the tail- 
stock. This is bad practice, for the removal of the material 
from the work may relieve internal stresses, especially in cold- 
rolled steel and in rolled or drawn brass. As a result, when 
the work is removed from the lathe, it is found to be bent, 
the tailstock having supported the work in a flexed condition. 
The better practice is to support the work between centers, 
using a follower rest to prevent flexure. Occasionally, a 
second tool is mounted on the opposite side of the work and 
in an inverted position. This serves to preserve the uniform 
diameter of the work. In thread cutting it can also serve to 
reduce the drunkenness of a long screw thread, but it obvi- 
ously requires very accurate setting of the two tools. 

In boring cylindrical holes, if the work is mounted on 
the spindle, the truth of the work is solely dependent upon 
the truth of the ways. If the work is mounted on the carri- 
age, however, a boring bar can be threaded through the 
rough bored hole and mounted between dead centers. A 
tool mounted on this bar describes a very nearly perfect 
circle, and as the work is fed over it, a hole of uniform 
diameter is automatically generated. The straightness of 
the ways determines the straightness of the hole, but paral- 
lelism (or the lack of it) of the ways to the axis of the spindle 
or to the axis of the boring is of no moment. For short holes 
a fly cutter may be mounted on the spindle, and the result 
will be the same as with a boring bar. In most work which 
can be mounted on the spindle the hole is bored to almost 
the required size, and then a reamer is passed through it to 
bring it to size and uniform diameter. 

In turning long tapers, a taper attachment should be used, 
if one is available. If not, the work is mounted on dead 
centers, and the tailstock is set over the proper amount. 
The angle of taper is a function of both the amount of the 



576 



CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN [Chap. XIV 



setover and the length of the work. Since the length of the 
work, that is, the distance between the points where the axis 
of the work intersects the axes of the headstock and the 
tailstock, cannot be accurately measured, it is impossible to 
predetermine the exact angle of the taper which will be cut. 
Consequently, the amount of setover of the tailstock must be 
determined by trial. 

The compound-slide rest is used to cut short tapers. It 
is usually the least accurate feature of the lathe, so that high

precision with it is not to be expected. The graduations 
which are used to determine the angle of motion are gener- 
ally very inaccurate and should be regarded only as some- 
thing on which to base an estimate. The slide, because of its 
shortness, is usually not straight. It can nevertheless be 
used successfully for turning and boring short tapers to 
match, such as for lug valves and stopcocks, since the errors 
of curvature can be made to match. The female part is 
first mounted on the spindle, and the tapered hole is bored 
with the boring tool cutting on the far side of the hole, the 



Chap. XIV] CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN 577 

lathe running backwards. When this is done, the face plate 
or chuck holding the piece should be removed bodily from 
the lathe, leaving the work undisturbed. This will permit 
the replacing of it for further operations, if necessary, with- 
out having to recenter the work. The male taper is then 
mounted, preferably between dead centers, and turned, the 
compound rest being used as it was set for boring, thereby 
insuring that the tapers will match. If the slide is not 
straight, the tool should be set so that its tip overhangs the 
slide as much as did the boring tool for the female part. If 
the same part of the slide is used, the errors in one taper will 
match those of the other. The male part, being on dead 
centers, may be removed from the lathe and tried in the 
female part and replaced for further machining, until the 
desired fit is obtained. For the final fit they should be lapped 
together with Bon Ami or some other suitable abrasive. 
(See Fig. 5.) 

We cannot go into the arts of filing and scraping. They 
are treated in many of the standard works on machine prac- 
tice and tool making. Filing and scraping afford the 
machinist opportunity for the fullest display of his manual 
skill. Both are, like the figuring of an optical surface, a 
process of delicate testing alternated with the careful manual 
removal of metal in order to obtain the desired surface. In 
filing, the testing is usually executed with the ordinary 
measuring instruments — the straightedge, the square, and 
the calipers. In scraping, the testing is done with Prussian 
blue, and always the two parts are scraped until an intimate 
and complete contact between them is obtained. Testing 
flats are made three at a time. The three plates are each 
scraped until any one of them will make satisfactory contact 
with either of the other two. 

From the above discussion it will be noted that the limits 
of accuracy characteristic of the different operations can be 
roughly classified. There are, on the one hand, operations 
such as the generation of a circular cut, or the fitting of a 
taper to a cone by lapping, which are automatically accurate 



578 CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN [Chap. XIV 

to a high degree. There are other operations which depend 
upon the truth built into the machine, for example, the 
cutting of a straight cylinder in a lathe or the milling of 
ways. Finally, there are those operations which depend 
upon the skill of the machinist. Examples are the mounting 
of work in the machine in order to have new cuts consistent 
with former ones, and the execution of filing operations to a 
line. There are many opportunities for the machinist to 
use his ingenuity to advantage in the attainment of precision. 
We have already mentioned examples in which the cuts on 
work in the three-jawed chuck are all done at one mounting, 
and in which the same part of the compound-slide ways are 
used for cutting male and female tapers, and so forth. 

Soft soldering. Good soldered joints require thorough 
cleaning and, in addition, the use of a so-called "flux." The 
function of the flux is to etch the surface free of contami- 
nation and protect it, as well as the solder, from oxidation. 

The most useful flux for soft soldering is made from a 
mixture of 2 parts zinc chloride to 1 part ammonium chloride 
dissolved in a minimum amount of water. This flux is often 
spattered about when the soldering copper is applied, and 
unless it is thoroughly removed, it promotes corrosion, 
especially on iron. If the work is washed with soda solution, 
the corrosive action of zinc chloride and acid flux is, in large 
measure, neutralized. In addition to corrosion, the spat- 
tered flux may also give rise to electrically conducting surface 
layers on parts of the apparatus where high insulation is 
required. For such work, a solution of rosin in alcohol is an 
excellent nonconducting flux (for soldering copper wires). 
Also, so-called noncorrosive pastes are available at most 
hardware stores. These are made from vaseline (90 per cent) 
and ammonium chloride (10 per cent). 

Three things are needed for successful soldering. In 
addition to cleanliness and flux, sufficient heat is required. 
Some soldering is done entirely with a flame, while some is 
done entirely with a soldering copper. However, the nicest 
jobs are done with a combination of these, especially when 



Chap. XIV] CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN 



579 



Solder 



the work is on complicated apparatus and when several 
relatively large parts are to be joined together. A soft 
flame played over the surface of the whole work supplies 
basic heat, keeping the work at a temperature of 125° to 
150 °C. The higher temperature that is required for solder- 
ing is then obtained locally by the application of the hot 
soldering copper. This soldering procedure minimizes the 
danger of melting off parts previously joined, a possibility to 
contend with when a flame alone is used. Also, the amount 
of solder added and the extent to which the solder flows is 
more easily controlled with the soldering copper than with a 
flame alone. On the other hand, the use of a flame to supply 
basic heat facilitates heating with the soldering copper and 
increases the effectiveness with which the molten solder can 
be made to wet the work and 
flow as desired. 

A seam to be soldered is first 
"tinned" at a high heat, and 
then at a lower temperature a 
fillet is made with the help of 
the soldering copper. The pur- 
pose of the fillet is to insure 
that the solder does not draw away and allow an opening to 
form in the seam as it cools. Fig. 6 shows how a recess cut in 
an inconspicuous place will serve the same purpose as a fillet. 

Many of the alloy steels, as well as cast iron, magnesium, 
aluminum, tungsten, and molybdenum, cannot be easily 
soft-soldered. 

Hard soldering. Although there are some intermediate 
solders which melt at temperatures between the melting 
temperatures of soft solder and silver solder, they have never 
had wide use. These solders may be useful in special cases, 
but for general work they do not have the reputation of 
silver solder, which, for strength, ductility, wetting power, 
penetration, and resistance to corrosion, is unsurpassed. 2 

2 Especially good for hard soldering is Easy-flo solder (M.P. 620°C), man- 
ufactured by the Handy and Harman Company, Bridgeport, Connecticut. 




Fig. 6. 



580 



CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN [Chap. XIV 



The heat for silver soldering is obtained with the oxy- 
acetylene torch for large work and with an air-gas or oxygen- 
gas torch for small work. The metal to be soldered is pre- 
heated, with the application of the flame favoring those 
parts which are most massive and which have the highest 
heat conduction. A general preheating of the whole work 
prevents warping and also facilitates the intense final heating 
of the joints that are to be brazed. 

The regions to be wet and joined by the silver alloy are 
painted with a thin paste mixture of 5 to 10 parts of pow- 
dered borax, 1 part powdered boracic acid, and water. Dry 
borax can also be used. The use of paste has the advantage 
of neatly defining the areas which will be wet with the alloy. 
The alloy will spread over the surface only to the extent that 
it has been brushed with the paste. The flux for stainless 
steel is made from 1 part borax and 1 part boracic acid, 
and these powders are wet with a saturated zinc chloride 
solution. 

For large work the silver solder is applied in the form of 
wire or rod after the work is well fluxed and has attained the 

proper temperature. The 
solder wire should also be 
coated with flux. For small 
work small pieces of silver 
solder, either short lengths of 
wire or bits of sheet solder, 
may be applied, togetherwith 
flux, before the work is 
heated. When the parts to 
be joined fit together neatly, 
only a film of the silver solder 
is needed to give a good joint. 
The use of more solder is 
wasteful. Charcoal (medi- 
cated so that it does not burn) and asbestos blocks can be 
used for holding the work and for proper positioning of the 
parts to be joined. (See Fig. 7.)

After the joint is made, the flux is best removed by quench- 
ing the work in cold water. This procedure is not recom- 
mended for large parts or for those requiring high accuracy, 
since some warping is always produced by quenching. Borax 
flux will dissolve slowly in hot dilute sulphuric acid in cases 
in which such treatment can be applied. 

Spot welding. Another much-used method of joining 
metals in the laboratory is spot welding with an electric 
current. Ordinarily, the spot-welding apparatus obtains its 
electric energy from a transformer with a capacity of 1 or 2 
kilowatts. The primary winding is connected to the alter- 
nating-current supply and it is equipped with taps or is 
connected in series with a rheostat to control the welding 
current. The secondary winding is usually a few turns of 
heavy copper wire on rod (about ■£§ inch in diameter), with 
the winding ratio such that the secondary delivers about 
6 volts. The heavy copper winding terminates at two 
copper electrodes, which serve to apply the potential to the 
joint to be welded. The welding is effected by the Joule 
heat generated between the metal surfaces to be welded 
when the current is passed in the primary of the transformer 
for a fraction of a second. The heating produced is regu- 
lated by the rheostat and by the length of the time that the 
switch is closed. The electrodes are brought in contact

with the work, and a definite pressure is applied, usually by 
means of a foot pedal. The pressure and duration of the 
current are important. Inadequate pressure results in burn- 
ing and "spitting" at the joint, while too much pressure 
decreases the joint resistance and consequently the heating 
action. 

Metals which weld together best are those of similar melt- 
ing temperature !T m C. and heat conduction K. Table I

given their attention. We will treat of the general aspects 

of the subject, such as the application of the principle of 

kinematical design and the 

calculation of deflections and 

flexures as they pertain to 

instruments. 

When an element of an in- 
strument is subjected to vary- 
ing forces that are due to un- 
even friction between the 
moving parts, the designer 
must be able to determine 
the effect of these variations. 

Such problems are often 
difficult to solve precisely, 
owing to the complex geome- 
try involved. However, it is 
often sufficient for the de- 
signer to know the answer to 
within 50 or 100 per cent. 
Estimations to this accuracy 
are often possible if one makes 
an ingenious choice of a simple 
geometric shape whose deflec- 
tion may be taken as a first 
approximation to the deflec- 
tion of the part in question. 
The formulas for determining 
the deflections of the simple 
geometrical shapes, variously 
loaded and supported, are 
given in Fig. 8. The moments 
of inertia of the cross section 
of beams about the axis 
passing through their center of gravity are required for 
these calculations. The moments of inertia for rectangular 
bars, rods, tubes, and I-beams are given in Fig. 9.

Accordingly, for the construction of spectrometers and other 
instruments, which require very accurate relative positioning 
of the various elements, the physicist often uses an I-beam 
of generous proportions and excessive strength. If the in- 
strument is a spectrometer, one or more of the faces of the 
I-beam are planed to afford a base for the mounting of 
lenses, slits, and a prism or 
grating table. 

Kinematical design.* The 
different ways in which the 
principle of kinematical design 
may be used for positioning 
the various elements of an 
instrument are illustrated by 
Figs. 11 to 23. 

According to the principle of kinematical design, a body 
must have at least (6 — n) points in contact with a second 
reference body if it is to have only n degrees of freedom, 
relative to the reference body. Fig. 11 shows a spherical 
ball held in a trihedral cavity in a plate by the force of grav- 
ity. Relative to the plate, the center of the ball is uniquely 
defined by the three contacts with the plate. There remain 

three degrees of freedom of ro- 
tation for the ball about three 
mutually perpendicular axes. 

The principle of kinemati- 
cal design is further illustrated 
by Fig. 12, which shows a tri- 
pod with a ball at the extremity 
of each of its legs. The plate 
on which the tripod rests has 
a V-groove and a trihedral cavity in its surface. One ball 
rests in the cavity, the second in the groove, and the third

on the plane surface of the plate. When one of the balls is 
in the trihedral cavity, then, as far as translations are con- 
cerned, the tripod may be regarded as fixed by the three 
points of bearing between the ball and the sides of the tri- 
hedral cavity. If, however, a second foot rests in the 

V-groove, there are two more 
point contacts between the ball 
and the sides of the groove. The 
tripod is now restrained by five 
point contacts and has, accord- 
ingly, one degree of freedom, which 
is a rotation about an axis pass- 
ing through the centers of the 
constrained balls. The tripod's 
position is finally completely determined when the third leg 
comes to rest on the plane, giving the sixth point of contact. 
Fig. 13 shows another way in which the tripod may have 
its position uniquely defined relative to a base plate. Here 
the terminal balls of the tripod legs rest in radial grooves 
machined in the plate. Each ball makes two contacts with 
the base plate, making a total of six contacts. 

These applications of kinematical design are often useful, 
as, for example, when the 
base plate is attached to an 
instrument and the tripod 
carries some element which 
must be repeatedly removed 
and replaced in exactly the 
same position. The applica- 
tion shown in Fig. 13 has the 
advantage over the one 
shown in Fig. 12 that the 
centers of the table and the base plate have the same re- 
lation to each other laterally, independent of difference 
in their temperature expansion. 

Fig. 14 shows a case in which one degree of freedom, that 
is, of translation, is achieved by placing two balls in V-

grooves, with the third on a flat surface. Five contacts 
between the plate and the tri- 
pod are involved. 

Other examples of the 
achievement of one degree of 
freedom by five appropriate con- 
tacts are shown in Figs. 15 to 19. 
The method shown in Fig. 15, 
and especially Fig. 16, is often 
used for typewriter carriages. 

Figs. 17 and 18 are more or 
less self-explanatory. In 
Fig. 17 gravity acts as the so-called locator. The locator, as 
its name implies, insures that the bearing points remain in 

contact. The arrangement 
shown in Fig. 18 is used by 
the Leitz Company for the 
vertical motion of their mi- 
croscope tube. 

Fig. 19 shows a simple and 
easily constructed device used 
to move a Foucault testing 
knife edge. Its design is kinematical. 

In most of the examples given here the contacting areas 
are small. Accordingly, the 
wear on them may be great. 
Often, in practice, point con- 
tacts are extended to line con- 
tacts as shown in Figs. 20, 21, 
and 22. Or, point contacts 
may be extended to surface 
contacts, as shown in Fig. 24. 
Even so, one still retains sub- 
stantially all of the virtues of 
the more rigorous type of de- 
sign, where contact areas are 
small. And, in addition, wear is materially reduced.

Fig. 20 shows how one degree of freedom is achieved for 
focusing the reading microscope of the Cambridge Instru- 
ment Company's comparator. 
Fig. 21 shows a type of sup- 
port which might be used for 
an optical bench. For example, 
with it a lens holder may be 
moved back andf orth alongtwo 
horizontal rods and clamped at 
any desired position. 

Fig. 22 illustrates how one 
degree of rotation may be 
obtained. The rod involved 
here may also translate along 
its axis unless a constraint is 
applied, as, for example, a fixed 
ball in contact with the end of 
the rod. 

Fig. 23 shows how geometrical design may be applied to 
a tangent screw. 

Generally, the construction of an instrument is easier if 
the design follows the kinematical principle than it is when

machine design. Conventional designs, in which one uses

cones, ways, and lapped journals to achieve one degree of 
freedom, either lead to overconstraint in the position of the 
parts or they are not uniquely defined. Only five contacts 
are required to constrain the parts as desired; any more are 
redundant, like the fourth leg of 
a stool. 

Although one degree of trans- 
lation is achieved easily by fol- 
lowing the kinematical princi- 
ple, as we have seen in Figs. 14 
to 21, the conventional cone, 
when properly lapped, affords 
a better construction for the 
achievement of one degree of 
freedom of rotation. 

One feature of the kinematical design which distinguishes 
it is exemplified by the figures illustrating one degree of 
translation, such as Fig. 17; although the motion may not be

straight, owing to imperfect construction, still it is possible 
to predict the deviation from straightness from the measured 
errors of construction. 

Steel balls are often used in kinematical design. They

are obtainable matched in size to 0.00005 inch, and in addi- 
tion they are truly spherical to this accuracy. Precision 

balls can be obtained which 
are spherical to within a tenth 
of the limit mentioned above. 
Fig. 25 shows a good de- 
sign of an adjustable mirror 
cell. It will be noted that 
this cell has four adjusting 
screws. Because it facili- 
tates the making of the ad- 
justments, this number is rec- 
ommended instead of three, 
in spite of the fact that one 
of the screws is not needed, 
and its use leads to strain in 
the cell. 

Vibrationless supports. Many delicate instruments and 
particularly high-sensitivity galvanometers, must be pro- 
tected from the vibrations produced by automobiles in the 
street, elevators, machinery in the basement, and vibrations 
from other sources which are always present in a building. 
In most cases, the vertical components of these vibrations

are harmless and can be ignored. Although the effect of the 
horizontal components on an instrument such as a galva- 
nometer may be small, especially if the moving system is 



Chap. XIV] CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN 591 

dynamically balanced on its suspension fiber, it is, however, 
necessary for the most delicate work to eliminate these 
horizontal components as far as possible by mounting the 
instrument on a vibrationless support. 

The problems involved in obtaining a suitable support are 
similar to some of the problems encountered in designing a 
seismograph, and anyone planning to develop a special 
vibrationless support of his own design will find the literature 
on seismographs helpful. Briefly, all vibrationless supports 
can be considered as an oscillating system loosely coupled 
mechanically to the walls, ceiling, or floor of the room. The 
shielding effect of the support is determined by the resonance 
between it and the wall. For example, if the natural period 
of oscillation of the support is long compared to that of the 
vibrations of the wall, it will be so far out of resonance that 
its response will be feeble. It is, of course, necessary that 
the support be damped so that its own natural oscillations 
will be suppressed. Also, it must be protected from air 
currents. Naturally, one selects the most stable place for 
mounting the vibrationless support. A pier which has a 
separate foundation from the rest of the building is ideal. 

A modification of the Julius suspension has been designed 
by R. Miiller. 5 This suppresses only the horizontal vibra- 
tions. A simplified construction of his design, which has 
been used successfully by the author, is shown in Fig. 19, 
Chapter VIII. The support is loaded so that it has a period 
of about 2 seconds. This support uses the internal friction 
of oil in pie pans to dampen it. Light oil is used, and the 
pans are filled to the height which is observed to produce 
maximum damping of the natural oscillations of the system. 
The advantages of this support over a Julius suspension are 
that it can be mounted on a shelf in the corner of the room 
and easily boxed in to protect it from air currents, whereas a 
Julius suspension must be hung from the ceiling. It is more 
difficult to make adjustments of the galvanometer with the 
Julius suspension than with this support, because the Julius

592 CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN [Chap. XIV 

suspension is not easily clamped. The Muller support can 
easily be clamped for making adjustments of the galvanom- 
eter by dropping two tapered pins in the holes indicated in 
the figure. 

One type of vibrationless support is made by placing a 
large mass, say a slab of stone, on a pile of newspapers. 
Here the shearing friction in the papers damps horizontal 
oscillations. Another method involves supporting the ma- 
chine by steel springs wound with friction tape for damping. 

Other methods of eliminating vibrations involve support- 
ing apparatus on tennis balls or sponge rubber. These are 
particularly useful for stopping vibrations near their source, 
as, for example, preventing vibrations from vacuum pumps 
from being transmitted into the walls and floor of the build- 
ing. The damping in this case is due to the internal friction 
of the rubber.
