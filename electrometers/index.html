Definitions. It is not always clear just what distinguishes 
an electrometer from an electroscope, and there seems to be 
some confusion in the literature. For purposes of this dis- 
cussion the following distinction will be made: An electro- 
scope is an electrostatic measuring device in which only one 
potential difference is needed for its operation. Electrom- 
eters, on the other hand, need auxiliary potentials for their 
operation. The familiar gold-leaf electroscope and the 
quadrant electrometer are respective examples. 

General theory. 1 Expressed in terms of Maxwell's 
coefficients, the electrostatic energy of any system of con- 
ductors at potentials Vi, V2, ... V„ is given by 2 

W = KdilV + 2c u F 1 7, +...) = |2QF, (1)

the Q's being the charges on the conductors. The coefficients 
have the properties that c tf = c n . c n is the charge which 
is on conductor 1 when all the other bodies are grounded and

1 has a potential of unity. Similarly c i2 is the charge in- 
duced on 1 when all the other bodies are grounded and unit 
potential is placed on 2. 

If the c's are functions of a coordinate i- and the V's are 
kept constant, then the force or torque tending to in- 
crease £ is 

f ^(-> ,+2 f >''"' + -- •> (3) 

In all instruments this electrical force or torque is balanced 
by some restoring force. If we know how the c's and the 
restoring force depend on £, then with the help of Eq. 3 we 
can solve for the voltage sensitivity. 

Since most electroscopes and electrometers are used to 
measure electric charge, it is the charge sensitivity in which 
we are interested, although the voltage sensitivity is the 
more easily measured. 

Referring back to Eq. 2, let i be the moving system. The 
charge sensitivity, S Q , is given by 

1 dQ t dVi „ dCa ... 

s Q = ^ = ca ^ + vl ~w + - • ■• (4) 

since both the c's and the V's are, in general, each functions 
of the coordinate. 

Applications to electroscopes. The above theory when 
applied to electroscopes becomes very simple. In this 
instance we have but two conductors, usually one completely 
surrounding the other. Let the case be grounded. Then 
Eq. 1 becomes merely W = \cV 2 , where c is the capacity 
of the electroscope system to the case, c must be a function 
of the displacement and in most instances can be considered 
a linear function, that is, c — c + b%. For this case Eq. 3 
becomes dW/di; = §5F 2 . If this is balanced by a force 
proportional to the displacement, then ki; = %bV 2 , and the 
voltage sensitivity is 

bv -W'~k' (5)

From Eq. 4, the charge sensitivity, S Q , is given by 

i"«f + F t- (6) 

Now dV/di; is given by Eq. 5, and dc/di; = b if c is a linear 
function of £. Therefore 

^ ~ cfc + F 2 6 2 l '' 

For most electroscopes, b 2 V 2 is small compared with ck, so 
that we can usually write 

This last relationship between the voltage and charge 
sensitivities is the usual assumption made when working 
with electroscopes. 

However, b 2 V 2 need not be small compared with ck, and it 
is interesting to see what follows in such a case. It will be 
seen that Eq. 7 has a maximum value when V<?b 2 = ck, and 
under these conditions 

0Sg)max. = i£ck)- M = 2^- 

The effective capacity has increased to 

dQ 

c - i£ - 2c 

efl - ~ dV 

Any further increase in the voltage sensitivity results in a 
more rapidly increasing capacity and a decrease in charge 
sensitivity. 

These conditions more aptly apply to electrometers and 
will be discussed in that connection in the following section. 

Applications to electrometers. All electrometers can be 
considered as made from three conductors, two of which are 
stationary and usually similar, while the third is movable. 
All three are connected electrically to the outside of the in- 
strument. We shall assume in the following discussion that 



220 ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES [Chap. VI 

the charge or potential to be measured is applied to the 
movable system, while the two stationary parts are main- 
tained at equal and opposite potentials. This arrange- 
ment is not necessary, and in general the following discussion 
holds equally well for the case when the charge or potential 
to be measured is applied to a stationary part and the mov- 
ing system is kept at the high potential. It is further 
assumed that the electrical and mechanical zeros of the in- 
strument coincide. This last condition is fulfilled if, while 
the movable system is grounded with equal and opposite 
potentials applied to the stationary parts, no deflection takes 
place. 

Of the twenty-seven terms in Eq. 3, twenty-five are small 
or zero, as compared with the remaining two under the above 
conditions. If the moving part is symmetrical with respect 
to the stationary parts, then these two terms are equal, 

and Eq. 3 becomes aTT7 , 

^ dW ,. ,, dew 

__ = Vl V^, 

where Ci 3 is the capacity between the moving system and one 
of the stationary parts, which is at a potential Vi, while Vz is 
the potential of the moving system. 

Case I. In general, c 13 will be a complicated function of |. 
This is especially true in the case of most string elec- 
trometers, but with the Hoffmann and Dolezalek the de- 
pendence of the capacity on the displacement is approxi- 
mately linear. For these instruments Ci 3 = Cu° + bd, and 

the torque becomes T T , T , , ... 

^ L = ViV 3 o. (9) 

In equilibrium, L = kd, where k is the torsion constant of 
the suspension. It will be noticed that Eq. 9 is symmetrical 
in Vi and V s , so that the sensitivity is the same whether the 
stationary or the moving parts are at the fixed potential. 
Assuming that the stationary parts are kept at a fixed po- 
tential, the voltage sensitivity is 

S V = ^- (10) 



Chap. VI] ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES 221 



The charge on the moving system, 3, becomes 

Qa = CiaVi + C 2i V 2 + C33F3. 

Now the moving system is connected to a suspension which 
in turn is connected to an external capacity. Let the sum 
of these two capacities be denoted by c e . If a charge q is 
placed on the system, then Q 3 = q — V 3 Ce, and we have

changed, is shown in Fig. 1.

mined, as will be seen from what follows. The effective

at the optimum value of V\. The procedure is as follows: 
Determine the electrostatic capacity of the suspension and 

moving system, together with any 
permanently connected capacity 
such as an ion chamber. Call this 
total c. Compare the deflection of 
the electrometer when a potential V 
is applied with that obtained when 
the same potential is applied 
through a known capacity c s as 
shown in Fig. 2. Then when the 
ratio of the deflections in the two

cases is

terms of a standard capac- " 2 c s 

Vi has the proper value. 
The period may also be computed. When there is no net 
charge on the electrometer and when potentials are on the 
binants or quadrants, let the system be deflected through 
an angle 6 by some external means and then allowed to 
vibrate. By Eq. 11,

where I is the moment of inertia of the moving system. 
Now at the optimum value of Vi, 2V i i b 2 = ck, and hence 
the corresponding period is

In other words the period has become 40 per cent less than 
when no potentials are applied. The maximum charge 
sensitivity in terms of the period, capacity, and moment of 
inertia of the system becomes 

(*S B ) max . = f(cl)-™. (13) 

Case II. If the coefficients Cu and c iS are quadratic 
functions of the displacement, that is, if 

c u = c 13 ° + be + gP, 

the values of the voltage and charge sensitivities are as 
follows :

and 

(S.W = l(2cfc)- 1/2 . 

This last is just what was obtained when the dependence of 
the capacity between the moving and stationary parts was 
a linear function of the displacement. 

The effective capacity at the maximum charge sensitivity 
is the same as in the simpler case, namely, twice the pure 
electrostatic capacity. 

The total torque may be written as 

If g is positive, then the electrometer has what is known as 
positive control, while if g is negative, it has negative con- 
trol. In the latter case the net torque may become zero at 
some point of the deflection, in which case the instrument 
becomes unstable. This frequently occurs when the sensi- 
tivity is high and is especially true with string electrometers, 
limiting the useful range to deflections near the midpoint. 
The period becomes longer if g is negative and will become 
longer the greater the amplitude of vibration. 

It will be seen from the characteristics of the instrument 
in Case II that they are not so desirable as those in Case I, 
since they depend on the amount of displacement. How- 
ever, there may be other advantages which make instru- 
ments of the second type more desirable, such as portability, 
ease of operation, and so forth. It should be borne in mind 
also that the above theory contains many simplifying 
assumptions, and the actual behavior of the instrument in 
some cases may be quite different. The chief differences are 
due to (1) a more complicated dependence of the capacity, 
between the stationary and moving parts, on the displace- 
ment and (2) air damping of the moving system. It is 
important to realize that where electrical charge is to be 



Chap. VI] ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES 225 



measured, there is an optimum value of the potential 
applied to the stationary parts for which the charge sensi- 
tivity has either an optimum or a maximum value, and that 
there is experimentally an easy way to test for such a condi- 
tion. 

Some types of electroscopes. The familiar gold-leaf 
electroscope is made either with a vertical stationary metal 
piece and a single strip of gold leaf fastened near the top, 
or with two gold leaves mu- 
tually repelling each other as 
shown in Fig. 3. The lead- 
in is insulated from the metal 
box with an amber or sulphur 
bushing. The capacity will 
be from 3 to 5 cm and the 
potential necessary to give a 
45° deflection will be from 300 
to 500 volts. When the leaf is 
observed with a microscope 
or a telescope, it becomes a 
quantitative instrument and 
will serve many purposes 
where high charge sensitivity 
is not important. The tech- 
nique of mounting the gold leaves will be discussed at the 
end of this chapter. 

The Wilson tilted electroscope, designed by C. T. R. 
Wilson 3 and G. W. C. Kaye, 4 is a hybrid of the electroscope 
and the electrometer. The narrow gold leaf in Fig. 4(a) 
hangs normally in a downward position, and is observed by 
means of a microscope with a micrometer ocular. A po- 
tential of about 200 volts is applied to the plate. This 
plate is adjustable; that is, it can be moved in or out along 
the axis of its support. The proximity of the plate and the

potential applied to it give an electrostatic control which 
tends to neutralize the effect of gravity on the leaf. 

Three cases in general may be cited for the voltage sensi- 
tivity as shown in Fig. 4(b): Case I, where there is little 
electrostatic control and the voltage sensitivity is linear 
over the entire scale; Case II, where the leaf is stable over 
the whole range but the electrostatic control is almost 
sufficient to neutralize the effect of gravity over part of the 



gold leaf

range; Case III, where there is an unstable region and conse- 
quently two "zeros." Case II is the most useful, and if 
deflections are taken over the same regions of the scale, 
there is no trouble about nonlinearity. 

The Wilson tilted electroscope, while it may find a use in 
some types of work, has been largely displaced by more 
modern instruments, such as quadrant and string electrom- 
eters. 

The Wiilf bifilar electroscope 5 has frequently been used in 
cosmic-ray work. It is well suited for a portable instru-

ment but must be read in a fixed position. As is the case 
with most electroscopes, not only the reading but also the 
calibration is affected by tilting the instrument. It is 
usually enclosed in an airtight ionization chamber, in which 
the gas pressure is often increased to increase the number of 
ions formed by a given radiation. The charge is renewed 
on the electroscope either by 
a mechanical arm working 
through an airtight bushing 
in the wall or, what is better, 
by an internal arm operated 
by an electromagnet. 

The construction of the 
electroscope proper is shown 
in Fig. 5. A clean quartz rod 
is cemented into the metal 
piece which holds a short 0.5- 
mm rod by means of a set- 
screw. The small rod is flat- 
tened at the lower end. Two 
metal-coated straight quartz 
fibers from 5 to 10 cm long 
and from 10/j to 20 /j, in di- 
ameter are cemented or sol- 
dered (with Wood's metal) 
to the flattened piece. The 
lower ends of the two fibers 
are cemented side by side 
to an insulating quartz bow made from 10^i to 20/j fiber. It 
is essential that the fibers, when uncharged, hang parallel to 
each other. Means of straightening quartz fiber will be found 
in Chapter V. If shellac is used as a cement, there will be 
sufficient conductivity from the metal to the fibers. The 
potential of 200 to 400 volts is applied to the upper metal 
support. If the fibers are 20(jl in diameter and 8 cm long, a 
spread of 3 mm will be produced by about 300 volts. The 
capacity will be in the neighborhood of 1 cm.

The plane of motion of the fibers should be perpendicular 
to the optical axis of the microscope, the necessary adjust- 
ment being made by rotating the piece held by the setscrew. 

It is possible to increase the sensitivity of the Wulf electro- 
scope either by increasing the magnification of the micro- 
scope or by decreasing the diameter of the fibers. However, 
this is limited by the fact that the collecting potential for 
the ions should not drop too low, depending on the nature of 
the gas and its pressure. It is customary to have a collecting 
potential of not less than 100 volts.

where v is the volume of the ion

vary with the spread of the 
fibers. The determination of 
c for different displacements 
amounts to the determination 
of b in c = Co + &£. 

Regener's electroscope is a 
single-fiber type shown in Fig. 6. 
The conducting quartz fiber 
or Wollaston wire is mounted 
near a metal piece and is held taut by a fine bow. The 
whole is supported by a quartz insulator, and the charge is 
renewed in a way similar to that used with the Wulf type. 

Lauritsen has used a small quartz-fiber electroscope with 
much success not only in small pocket dose-meters for

X-ray work but also in measuring radiations found in nuclear 
investigations. Its outstanding feature is its simplicity. 
A wire is flattened at one end and bent over at right angles. 
A 5m (0.005-mm) metal-coated quartz fiber about 6 mm long 
is cemented to this flat piece with shellac or colloidal graphite, 
making an angle with the wire support as shown in Fig. 7. 
A short piece of the same size fiber is cemented to the end of 
the longer fiber, at right angles to the plane of the wire and 
to the first fiber. This added piece is to form an index for 
viewing with a microscope. The wire support is mounted 
in an amber insulator, which in turn is mounted on the end

of the microscope. When the electroscope is used inside 
an ionization chamber, contact is made by a movable arm to 
the base of the metal support. 

In order to obtain reliable readings on cosmic rays in air- 
planes, a torsion type of electroscope was developed in 1932. 
It was necessary to have a self-recording instrument of high 
sensitivity, the readings of which would not be affected by 
tilt or vibration of the plane. As far as tilt is concerned, 
this effect on the readings can be reduced to less than 0.001 
of the total deflection for a tilt of 90°. As for vibration, satis- 
factory readings have been obtained with the electroscope 
mounted within 3 feet of the engine in a pursuit airplane. 

A drawing of the electroscope is reproduced in Fig. 8. 
It is made entirely of fused quartz. The torsion fiber is 
stretched until its length is increased about 1 per cent. 
The crossarm is bent at right angles at one end and, in case 
high magnification is used, it is drawn down to a convenient 
size. A short bit of fiber serves as a fiducial mark. The 



230 ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES [Chap. VI 



shapes of the stationary parts combine to give a linear scale 
over most of the range of discharge. A piece of platinum 
cemented to the quartz with a polymerizing cement is the 
point at which a new charge is placed on the system. With 
a very small oxygen-gas flame all joints are fused together 
so that the whole system becomes essentially one piece of

quartz. The system from the platinum down is covered 
with a conducting layer of gold. The vane is balanced by 
cutting off one end. For many applications this balancing 
need not be done with great care and, in fact, becomes rather 
delicate if a very fine torsion fiber is used. If too much is 
cut off, mass can be added by applying some thin gold china 
paint 6 and heating it with a hot wire. 

6 See Chapter V. 



Chap. VI] ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES 231 

In general it will be necessary to put a permanent twist in 
the torsion fiber. This can be done by forcing the vane 
beyond the stop through the desired angle, relieving the 
tension by pushing on the bow at the bottom, and heating 
the fiber at each end with a small pure gas flame. This will 
soften the quartz just enough. The twist, of course, must be 
put in before the system is covered with its conducting coat- 
ing of metal. The following illustration gives some idea of 
how much twist is needed: With a torsion fiber 5m in di- 
ameter and 12 mm long and a crossarm or vane 18 mm long, 
if a 30° twist is put in the fiber, the deflection will begin at 
about 200 volts and the sensitivity will be about 2 X 10~ 3 
radian/volt. The electrostatic capacity will be about 0.5 cm 
and the charge sensitivity about 1.2 radians/statcoulomb. 

Assuming a rigidity modulus of 5 X 10 11 dynes cm -2 , the 
torsion constant comes out 1 X 10 -2 dyne cm radian -1 under 
the above specifications, and b (see Eq. 5) has a value of 

b = ^- = 0.6 X 10" 2 cm radian" 1 

with V = 1 statvolt. Since & is a geometrical quantity, it 
will not depend on the size of the torsion fiber. The above 
relation may be used to get an approximation to the sensi- 
tivity for other values of the torsion constant k. 

If a very fine torsion fiber is used, in order to keep the 
collecting voltage up it may be necessary to twist the torsion 
fiber around one or more times. If the crossarm is not larger 
than 20/j in diameter, this can be done manually after the 
conducting coat has been put on by using a needle and forc- 
ing the ends through, between the torsion fiber and the 
main quartz support. 

Some types of electrometers. The Dolezalek quadrant 
electrometer 7 is perhaps the most common type and the 
most useful. The general plan of the instrument is shown in

Instrument Company, Ltd., Cambridge, England, the Cambridge and Paul

other pair is grounded. The other way is to maintain one 
pair of quadrants at the potential + V and the other at — V 
and place the charge to be measured on the needle. The 
first method is illustrated in Fig. 10(a). V will usually be 
from 50 to 150 volts, depending on the desired sensitivity.

the potentiometer R', as rep- 
resented in Fig. 10 (c) . The for-

that the life of the high-volt-

shelf life, while the chief ad-

batteries maintain a remark- 
ably constant potential at no 
current over long periods of 
time and have a very low 
temperature coefficient, so 
that in many cases the first 
circuit can be used. 

An approximation can be 
made to the value b for the 
Dolezalek electrometer in 
terms of the geometry of the 
instrument. It will be seen 
that the vane is of such shape 
that the capacity between the 
vane and the box, as a deflec- 
tion takes place, varies linearly 
with the change of angle. Let 
be the deflection, R the radius of the vane, h the distance of 
the vane from one side of the box, and d the depth of the box.

and the maximum charge sensitivity becomes 

The effective capacity at this sensitivity is, of course, 2c, 
where c is the total electrostatic capacity on which the 
charge q is placed. 

Eqs. 14 and 15 predict a constant voltage and charge 
sensitivity for given values of the potential on the quadrants 
or on the needle and for given geometrical conditions. 
Actually, however, this is not the case, for it will be found 
that as the potential on the quadrants or on the needle, as 
the case may be, is increased, the period gradually lengthens, 
and a value is finally reached at which the vane becomes un- 
stable at a certain point of the scale. This behavior is due 
to the occurrence of nonlinear terms in the expression for 
the capacity between the vane and the quadrants. By 
careful adjustment the importance of these terms can be 
diminished but never eliminated. 



Chap. VI] ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES 235 

In setting up the Dolezalek electrometer, the vane should 
not be too close to either the top or the bottom of the box, 
since small variations due to changes in temperature and 
so forth will change the characteristics. Also, irregularities 
in the vane may make important nonlinear terms in the 
capacity between the vane and the quadrants. Although 
the maximum charge sensitivity is not affected by this 
distance, the optimum voltage and the voltage sensitivity are 
affected. 

The instrument is leveled until the piece holding the vane 
is in the center of the circular hole in the top of the box. 
A grounding switch, which may be manually or magnetically 
operated, must be provided. Care should be exercised not 
to introduce variable thermal e.m.f.'s. 

The torsion head should be adjusted so that each half of 
the vane lies as nearly as possible symmetrically between 
two quadrants. With the vane grounded, small values of 
+ V and — V are applied to the quadrants. Adjustment is 
made to the torsion head in the appropriate direction, so 
that whether a potential is on the quadrants or not, no mo- 
tion of the vane takes place. After the full values of ± V 
are placed on the quadrants, slight adjustments can be made 
with the potentiometer as shown in Figs. 10(b) and 10(c). 
This procedure is generally known as bringing the mechanical 
and electrical zeros together, and must be done with all 
forms of electrometers. 

In operation, the actual useful working value of the charge 
sensitivity will be about 

<S„ = 1.3 X 10 4 div./statcoulomb 
= 0.4 X 10 14 div./coulomb 
= 0.6 X 10" 5 div./electron. 

The corresponding voltage sensitivity will probably lie in 
the range ^ = mQ tQ 150Q div /yolt; 

while the optimum value of the voltage applied to the 
quadrants will probably be between 50 and 100 volts on 



236 ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES [Chap. VI 



each side of ground, or if the high potential is placed on the 
needle, it will usually be between 100 and 200 volts, depend- 
ing, among other things, on the size of the torsion fiber.

arranged that one quadrant can be raised or lowered with 
respect to the other three. Further dissymmetry is intro- 
duced by giving the vane an initial tilt. By proper adjust- 
ment of this movable quadrant the time consumed by the 
needle in returning to its initial position after a deflection 
may be lengthened (negative control) or shortened (positive 
control). The design of the instrument is shown in Fig. 11. 
The dissymmetry introduces additional nonlinear terms

into the change of capacity as the needle moves, and an elec- 
trostatic torque is introduced which either opposes the torque 
of the suspension (negative control) or aids it (positive 
control). In the extreme case the action of the suspension 
can be more than completely neutralized, so that an unstable 
instrument results. This means that the voltage sensitivity 
can be made extremely high. Fig. 12(a) illustrates the 
relationship between the voltage sensitivity and the voltage 
on the needle for different degrees of positive control, while 
Fig. 12(b) shows the same relationship for various degrees of 
negative control. In this latter case a stiffer suspension was 
used. The circles on curves 6, 7, 8, 9 represent the highest 



238 ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES [Chap. VI 

sensitivity at which the zero of the instrument is sufficiently 
stable to allow satisfactory measurements to be made. 
The small figures above the curves of Figs. 12(a) and 12(b) 
represent the time required in each case for the needle to 
return to within 1 mm of the rest position after a deflection 
of 50 mm. Because of the small restoring torque and high 
air damping, the motion of the suspended system is aperiodic. 

Where extremely small potentials are to be measured and 
where the demand on charge sensitivity is not too great, the 
Compton electrometer is very suitable. However, the same 
voltage sensitivity could be achieved with the usual quadrant 
electrometer by putting in a suspension fine enough to give 
the same time of return to zero, provided that the moving 
system were equally as light as that in the Compton. In 
fact, it will be noted from the curves that with neither posi- 
tive nor negative control, shown by the straight line of 
Fig. 12(a), but with a fine fiber, voltage sensitivities can be 
obtained equal to those with a stiff fiber and large negative 
control. This high voltage sensitivity is not always useful 
when measuring electric charges, which is the main purpose 
of electrometers, for not only does the instrument become 
very sluggish, but drifts become bad. Also, for a given time 
of return from a given deflection the charge sensitivity has a 
maximum value. 10 Wolf 11 states that the maximum usable 
charge sensitivity of the Compton electrometer is 2 X 10 14 
div./coulomb, which occurs at a voltage sensitivity of 5000 
div./volt. 

The Hoffmann electrometer 12 combines the highest charge 
sensitivity of any commercial instrument with stability, 
that is, lack of drift, and ease of working. Great care has 
been exercised to eliminate contact potentials, thermal 
e.m.f.'s, and air currents. To achieve the elimination of 
air currents, heavy copper pieces surround the movable

system to insure that thermal gradients are kept at a mini- 
mum. A decided advantage is gained also by evacuating 
the case to a few millimeters of mercury, thus making the 
instrument "deadbeat." 

The instrument operates upon essentially the same prin- 
ciple as the quadrant electrometer. The chief difference is

that a half vane is used for the movable system, so that, 
instead of quadrants, only two conductors, or binants, are 
necessary. Fig. 13 represents the relationships of the 
essential parts. The platinum needle and mirror together 
weigh approximately 5 mg, and the suspension is a 3/jl 
(0.0003-cm) Wollaston wire. 



240 ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES [Chap. VI 

To achieve a sensitivity independent of temperature, it is 
necessary to keep the vane or needle at the same distance 
from the binants. This is accomplished by inserting into the 
supports of the upper part of the electrometer case, which in 
turn supports the suspension, a metal of such coefficient of 
thermal expansion that the over-all expansion completely 
neutralizes the change of length of the torsion fiber with 
temperature. 

Contact and thermal electromotive forces are kept at a 
minimum by making everything from or plating it with 
platinum. Also, insulation is protected by metal, so that 
possible spurious charges cannot affect the system. 

Since the Hoffmann electrometer combines so many de- 
sirable features, it may be well to list some of them. These 
characteristics must be combined in any other instrument 
with which it is intended to push the charge sensitivity to 
that limit set by Brownian motion, and still have freedom 
from drift and a reasonable working period. 

1. The moment of inertia of the moving system must be 
small. (See Eq. 13.) 

2. The suspension must be made of material which has a 
small coefficient of internal friction; that is, the needle must 
return to zero after a deflection. 

3. Air currents must be kept at a minimum. This means 
that the moving system must be surrounded with heavy 
copper pieces. The suspension should be closely surrounded 
by metal pieces as well. 

4. The case must be evacuated to keep the working time 
within a reasonable limit. 

5. Temperature compensation is needed if the distance 
between the vane and the stationary parts is to remain 
constant. 

6. Thermal and contact electromotive forces must be 
eliminated. 

In addition to the above, it is usually desirable to have the 
scale approximately linear. 



Chap. VI] ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES 241 



Two additional features of the Hoffmann electrometer are 
(1) an electromagnetic grounding switch and (2) an induc- 
tion ring for inducing a charge on the movable system. 

To facilitate making the necessary electrical connections, 
a control mechanism is supplied with the instrument when 
it is purchased. Although not absolutely necessary, the 
control mechanism is a great aid, since the proper connec- 
tions are made and broken at the right time by only one 
operation. 

The latest model of the Hoffmann electrometer 13 combines 
all the desirable features of the earlier models but permits 
greater accessibility to the essential parts. Also the ad- 
justments are much more easily made; for example, in the 
older types the instrument had to be exhausted after adjust- 
ing the binants, while in the new design this adjustment is 
made through a sylphon from 
the outside. 

String electrometers are 
divided into two main divi- 
sions: (1) those with a fiber 
supported only at one end 
and (2) those in which the 
fiber is kept taut by a fine 
spring. The latter are the 
most common and, as far as is 
known, are the only ones on 
the market. 

Electrometers of the first Fig u An easily constructed 

class are easily made and are quartz-fiber electrometer in which 

often very satisfactory when * d fiber is su PP° rted on 'y at one 
high sensitivity is not needed. 

The two plates can be flat and the fiber hung down between 
them as shown in Fig. 14. There should be an adjustment 
either on the plates or on the fiber or on both to bring the 
mechanical and electrical zeros together. Some adjustment 
may be made by tipping the instrument in the appropriate

direction. A microscope must be provided to read the de- 
flection. With the plates 1 cm apart, the fiber should be 

about 25/* in diameter and 4 



cm long if the potential on 
the plates is not to exceed 
100 volts. 

Of the second type, that de- 
signed by Wiilf 14 is, perhaps, 
typical. It is shown diagram- 
matically in Fig. 15. The fi- 
ber is usually a Wollaston wire 
2n in diameter, kept taut by a 
quartz-fiber bow. Screw ad- 
justments permit movement 
of the plates with respect to 
the fiber as well as change in 
the tension of the fiber.

With all string electrometers the deflection is not a linear 
function of the applied charge or voltage at high sensitivity. 
It frequently happens that at high sensitivities the fiber 
leaves the field of view of the 
microscope as it reaches a posi- 
tion where instability occurs. 

The chief advantages of 
string electrometers are (1) 
portability, (2) ease of adjust- 
ment, and (3) short working 
time.

shown in Fig. 16. The two movable fibers are brought 
together at one end, and a small index, which is viewed with 
a microscope, is provided. The charge and voltage sensi- 
tivities are each greater than can be obtained with a string 
electrometer. Not only is it more sensitive, but it also 
combines all the advantages of the latter instrument. 

The Lindemann electrometer 16 was developed primarily 
for use with photoelectric cells mounted on telescopes in

of the needle is read with a microscope with a micrometer

quadrants and needle mountings are represented in Fig. 17.

The principle on which the instrument works is similar to 
the quadrant electrometer. The quadrants are 1.5 cm broad 
and 1 cm high, with a slot 2 mm wide, into which the needle 
may pass, cut in each. These plates are mounted 5 mm 
apart on quartz rods. The torsion-fiber mounting and 
needle are placed between the plates so that the junction of 
the needle and torsion fiber is symmetrically located with 
respect to the four plates. The whole is mounted in an 
aluminum box with suitable connections. Through a glass 
window in one side of the box the motion of the end 
of the needle is observed with a microscope. A window 
directly opposite on the other side of the case permits light 
to enter. 

The needle may be balanced so that a rotation of the 
instrument through 90° makes less than 0.06 mm motion of 
the end. The needle is usually about 1 cm long, and the 
torsion fiber is 6/* in diameter. The needle and torsion fiber 
are covered with a conducting coating of metal, and a suitable 
connection is made to the outside of the case. The quartz 
frame for holding the torsion fiber serves as insulation as 
well. 

Electrical connections are the same as for any quadrant 
electrometer. Instability occurs at a potential of about 
100 volts. At 3 volts below this unstable value the deflec- 
tion will reach 99 per cent of its final value in 1 second. 
The voltage sensitivity under these conditions is 0.76 mm/ volt 
motion of the end of the needle. With a suitable microscope 
a workable sensitivity of 500 div./volt can be obtained. 
The electrostatic capacity is about 2 cm. 

The instrument may conveniently be used with a leak to 
measure currents of from 10 -10 to 10~ 14 ampere. When not 
too great demands are to be met, this quite inexpensive 
electrometer will meet many needs, especially where porta- 
bility is a requirement.

the vacuum-tube electrometer, which uses specially con- 
structed vacuum tubes, see Chapter X. 



Chap. VI] ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES 245 

Some practical considerations in the use of electrometers 
and electroscopes. Useful sensitivity in X-ray work. 
Electrometers are frequently used with an ion chamber in 
X-ray work. As is well known, ions are formed not only by 
the X-ray beam but by (1) cosmic rays, (2) local radiation 
from radioactive matter in the surroundings, and (3) radio- 
active contamination on the inner walls of the ion chamber. 
Of these, (3) can be reduced to a small value in comparison 
with the others by two effective means. The inner walls 
can be painted with a mixture of collodion and lampblack, 
each of which is quite free from radioactive materials. 
The thickness should be about 0.05 mm to stop all the 
a particles. The other method is to maintain a fine wire 
grid at a suitable potential to drive the ions formed by 
the a particles back into the walls. Since in general (3) is 
due to particles which will have a range of less than 5 cm at 
normal air pressure, the range can be kept within the grid 
by a gas of high molecular weight or increased pressure, 
or both. Even rubbing Carborundum paper on the walls 
of the chamber will often help considerably in lowering the 
emission. As for (1), cosmic rays could be reduced to an 
extremely low value by going into a mine 100 to 200 feet 
below the surface of the ground, while (2) could be made 
negligible with 4 inches of surrounding lead. However, 
since it is not practical to go to such trouble, in most cases 
it is necessary to make the best of the situation. 

Since the error of a result which depends on the difference 
or sum of two readings is 17 

e = (ex 2 + €2 2 ) 1/2 , (16) 

where ei and e 2 are the errors of the two readings, it is hope- 
less to try to push the sensitivity of the measuring device 
beyond a certain point, and the only hope of increasing 
accuracy is by a longer period of observation. It is easily 
seen that the optimum useful value of the sensitivity is 

17 For a further discussion of probabilities and errors involved when a meas- 
urement depends on the effects of a finite number of particles, see page 298. 



246 ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES [Chap. VI 

reached when the deflection due to background only and the 
deflection due to the X-ray beam only are equal for the same 
time of observation. 

If the ratio of background to beam readings is to be made 
as small as possible, it is obvious that the volume also should 
be made as small as possible, since the background reading 
goes up with the volume. 

Example. Assume an ion chamber of 1000 cm 3 . Cosmic 
rays will contribute about 3 ions/cm 3 /sec. /atmosphere of 
air at sea level. Local radiation will be from 3 to 5 7 (ions 
cm -3 sec. -1 atmosphere -1 of air), while the background may 
vary over wide limits; from 0.1 to 10 ions cm -3 sec. -1 atmos- 
phere -1 of air will probably include the extreme cases. 
Since the a-particle paths will usually end in the gas, an 
increase of pressure will not change the number of ions 
formed by the a. particles, but the ionization due to local 
radiation and cosmic rays will go up as the pressure increases. 
Let us assume 77 as due to electrons and 57 as due to a par- 
ticles. The average path length of the electrons is about 
10 cm, and at 60 ions/cm of path this corresponds to about 
12 electrons/sec. crossing the chamber. In order to have a 
mean relative error of e h then according to the laws of proba- 
bility, 1/ei 2 particles must cross the chamber. Let ei be 
0.03, or 3 per cent; then 10 3 particles must be counted. This 
will take 80 seconds on the above assumptions. These 10 3 
electrons will form 6 X 10 5 ions. Hence if we assume the 
same fluctuations in the ions from the beam, then according 
to Eq. 16, to have an average error of 4 per cent in a reading, 
we must time for at least a minute, and the sensitivity of the 
electrometer need not be greater than 10 -6 div./ion if we 
estimate to 0.1 div. 

As for the a particles from the walls, their effect may be 
considered as follows: Supposing they amount to 57, which 
is not an uncommon value, then there will be 5000 ions/sec. 
formed. Now an a. particle will form, on the average, about 
10,000 ions in the gas. Hence there is 0.5 a particle/sec. 
emitted by the walls. Now if ei is the mean absolute error 



Chap. VI] ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES 247 

in a given reading and e 2 in another reading, the mean rela- 
tive error e r in the sum will be 

fa 2 + ^Y 12 ,„, 

where is the deflection of the instrument. If Ni is the 
number of particles per second of one kind of particle and 
7i the number of ions formed per particle, then it can be 
shown from Eq. 17 that the mean relative error of the sum is 



/ NJi* + AW y* ( (4.3 + 50) X 10 6 V /2 
tr \t{NxIi + NJt)*) V<(0.72 + 0.50) 2 X 10V 



under the above assumptions if the subscript 1 refers to the 
electrons and 2 refers to the a particles. It is then necessary 
to count for 400 seconds to gain an accuracy of 4 per cent. 
In this time 5 X 10 6 ions will have been collected. In order 
to read this to 4 per cent we need a sensitivity no greater 
than 10~ 6 div./ion. 

The above calculations have been made to show (1) the 
importance of eliminating a particles as much as possible 
and (2) that when this is done completely, the sensitivity 
of the electrometer has a limit beyond which there is no 
gain. 

If charges are to be collected where there is very little 
background, such as in photoelectric work, then there is no 
reason why the sensitivity cannot be pushed to the maxi- 
mum. In all cases, if possible, an electrometer or an 
electroscope suitable to the accuracy required should be 
chosen. 

Useful sensitivity in cosmic-ray work. In case the instru- 
ment is subject only to cosmic rays and no shielding is used, 
the ionization is due to random electrons and "X" particles, 
which ionize the gas the same as electrons. When this is so, 
the mean relative error is N~ 1/2 , where N is the total number 
of particles, the effects of which are measured. If there are 
n high-energy particles/cm 2 /sec, and if the mean relative

and this must give a deflection which can be read with no 
larger relative error than e T . If a = 60 ions cm -1 , R = 
10 cm, and e, = 0.01, then v = 8 X 10 6 ions, and we need 
a sensitivity of about 3 X 10~ 6 div./ion. Now n ^ 0.02 
electron/cm 2 /sec. at sea level. Hence the minimum time 
of observation should be 30 minutes, and for each observa- 
tion the mean error will be 1 per cent. This calculation, of 
course, neglects the error introduced by the background 
radiation. 

Frequently, however, the ionization chamber is surrounded 
with shields made of iron or lead. These do two things: 

(1) In general, they lessen the intensity of the radiation, and 

(2) they introduce new radiations. All the particles passing 
through the ionization chamber are no longer randomly 
distributed in time, for, in addition, there now exist showers, 
consisting of from two to several hundred electrons, which 
come all at the same time from some region of the shield. 
These introduce larger fluctuations than would otherwise 
exist, and the time of observation for the size of ion chamber 
assumed above may be from two to four times as long for 
the same error, and a correspondingly less sensitivity of the 
measuring instrument will serve the purpose. 

Steady deflection measurements. In some cases it may 
be desired to use the constant deflection instead of the drift 
method. This may be done by using the electrometer to 



Chap. VI] ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES 249 



measure the drop in potential across a fixed resistance as 
shown in Fig. 18. Assume that it is desired to measure a 
constant ion source /. Let the capacity to ground of the 
external system be Ci and of the electrometer c 2 , and let the 
drop in potential be measured across Ri. Then

Thus the potential across the electrometer rises exponen- 
tially. If we say arbitrarily that we shall wait until the 
deflection is 99 per cent of the ul- 
timate deflection, then we must 
wait a time t = 4.6 RiC, where 
c = Ci + c 2 . The deflection will 
be approximately VS r after this 
time. Had we measured I by the 
drift method, we should have the 
same deflection in a time RiC, the 
difference, of course, being due to 
the fact that in the second case 
the drift is constant, while in the 
first case the drift begins at the 
same rate, that is, as if Ri = oo t 
but gradually slows down, becom- 
ing very slow toward the last. 

It is therefore much more satisfactory to use the drift 
method for measuring feeble currents, while larger currents

250 ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES [Chap. VI 

are conveniently measured by the steady deflection method. 
The drift method can be used in measuring large currents 
also by inserting a capacity of the appropriate value to 
lengthen the time of drift. 

Limitations of various types of instruments. Limitation 
on the charge sensitivity of electroscopes and electrometers 
has already been pointed out. For the former the maximum 
charge sensitivity is 



(*J«)max. — rA C "v 



2 V ' 2VJ) 



and for the latter 



(AJmax. — o(.2c/Cj ~ AV h 

The capacity of an electroscope which has no external lead 
will depend on the particular design, but for the Wulf or 
torsion type it will lie between 0.4 and 1 cm. That of an 
electrometer with its added external capacity will probably 
be between 20 and 100 cm. The restoring constant, k, of 
the suspension can be reduced in each to a point where the 
sluggishness of the motion makes the instrument tedious 
to work with, or in the case of most electroscopes, where 
the collecting potential becomes too small to collect most of 
the ions. Since an electrometer case can be evacuated, it 
is possible to adjust the pressure until the motion of the 
vane or needle becomes critically damped. 

If the electrometer case is not evacuated, the working 
period may become excessively long when high sensitivities 
are desired. Much can be achieved by making the needle 
or vane small and light, as is done in the Lindemann and 
Perucca electrometers, and as is inherently the case with 
string electrometers. 

Limitations imposed by drift. The amount of drift during 
a reading is often the limiting factor in electrometers. This 
frequently becomes bothersome long before the maximum 
sensitivity has been reached. One of the chief reasons for 
the drift is that the mechanical and electrical zeros gradually 



Chap. VI] ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES 251 

drift apart. The deflection caused by the zeros being differ- 
ent may be many times the actual amount they are apart. 
Drift, among other causes, is due to (1) fluctuations in 
battery voltage and (2) nonelastic changes of strain in the 
suspension. If the drift were constant, proper allowances 
could be made, but there are so many factors which depend 
in a different way upon changes of voltages, temperature, 
humidity, and so forth, that it is often very difficult, if not 
impossible, to eliminate completely or take account of the 
drift. This is especially true with vacuum-tube electrom- 
eters, even though balanced circuits are used. 

Limitations on the amount of useful magnification. Two 
methods are in general use for determining the amount of 
deflection in an electroscope or electrometer: (1) Microscope 
with micrometer ocular and (2) mirror and scale. For the 
Lindemann electrometer and most electroscopes the micro- 
scope is used. The limitation as far as magnification is con- 
cerned amounts to a limitation of resolution. Magnification 
can continue until the position of a diffraction band cannot 
be located to within 0.1 div. in the eyepiece. Beyond this, 
nothing is gained. With a numerical aperture of 1 and an 
image distance of 20 cm the shortest useful focal length is 
about 3 mm with a 100-div. scale in the eyepiece 1 cm long. 

If a mirror and scale are used, there is a certain minimum 
mirror size which will allow sufficient resolution. With a 
1 mm div. scale at the customary distance of 1 m, it is 
necessary to have a mirror at least 2 mm in diameter to read 
to 0.1 div. on the scale. 

In all cases, whether in resolution, amount of drift, fluctua- 
tions, or the like, it should always be possible to estimate to 
0.1 of the smallest division on the scale, and in general it is 
useless to push the sensitivity of any instrument beyond the 
point where 0.1 div. loses its significance. 

Limitations imposed by Brownian motion. It is part of 
the classical theory of the equipartition of energy that all 
bodies have a mean thermal energy of \KT for each degree 
of freedom, where K is Boltzmann's constant and T the 



252 ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES [Chap. VI 

absolute temperature. This Brownian motion of the in- 
strument is evidenced by random fluctuations about the 
point of equilibrium. It is evident that before a super- 
imposed steady deflection can be detected, it must be at 
least as large as this mean Brownian deflection. 

The mechanical energy of a moving system with a restoring 
force proportional to the displacement is \ k£ 2 , where k is 
the restoring force (or torque) per unit of displacement. 
If A£ is the mean Brownian deflection, then the k corre- 
sponding to this is given by 

ffc(A£) 2 = \KT, 
or 

KT 



k = 



(AW 



Now with the electroscope the maximum charge sensitivity 
is reached when S Q = %(ck)~ 1/2 . Consequently, the corre- 
sponding charge sensitivity is 



2(KTc)v* 

if the deflection is equal to the mean Brownian deflection. 
At room temperature the maximum charge sensitivity is 
thus limited for electroscopes to 

0S<,)max. = — — J75 div./electron, 

where c is in centimeters. For electrometers the expression 

becomes ^ „ „ ,

It is obvious that the electrostatic capacity of the instru- 
ment should be as small as possible if it is intended to push 
the charge sensitivity to the limit. Inherently the capacity 
of the electroscope is much less than that of the electrometer. 
This not only makes it possible to have a higher charge 
sensitivity for the same torsion constant but allows it to be 
used. 



Chap. VI] ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES 253 

It is interesting to compare the above limit with that ob- 
tainable with a Geiger counter. In some applications the 
number of counts and the number of unit charges collected 
are comparable. The mean error with a Geiger counter in a 
single count of N particles distributed at random is N 1/2 , so 
that if it is desired to have a mean relative error of 1 per cent, 
it is necessary to count 1/(0.01) 2 or 10 4 particles. With an 
electroscope having a capacity of 0.5 cm, it is necessary to 
collect 8 X 10 4 electrons to have the same mean error if 
the deflection can be read to 0.1 div. This is, of course, 
disregarding the backgrounds in each case. 

A comparison of various types of instruments. Probably 
the most sensitive electrometer on the market is the Hoff- 
mann. The maximum sensitivity which can be reached 
with this instrument is approximately 5 X 10 15 div. /coulomb. 
Drift has been eliminated to such an extent that sufficient 
time can elapse to detect an average of 1 electron/sec. 
For ease of working, however, it is advisable to keep the 
charge sensitivity in the neighborhood of 1 X 10 15 div./cou- 
lomb. Much is gained in the Hoffmann by evacuating the 
case, thereby not only shortening the working time but 
greatly eliminating the effects of convection currents. 

The vacuum-tube electrometer has gained much favor in 
the past few years. It has the advantage that it can be 
used in places where it would be inconvenient or impossible 
to use the conventional type of electrometer. The sensi- 
tivity can be made comparable to that of the Hoffmann, 
although it is very much inferior as far as drifts are con- 
cerned. Ordinary precautions consist in having large stor- 
age batteries for plate and filament supply which are kept 
at as constant a temperature as possible, with all leads well 
shielded. Resistances must also be kept constant. Al- 
though with the proper circuit and circuit constants the 
effects of voltage fluctuations are reduced to a minimum, 
it is still not possible to eliminate the drift, and it is usually 
necessary to wait several hours after the connections are 
made for conditions to become only approximately steady. 



254 ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES [Chap. VI 

When possible, an instrument should be chosen for the 
problem at hand. Frequently it is desirable to use an elec- 
troscope in place of the electrometer. The advantages to 
be gained may be listed as follows: (1) Freedom from ex- 
ternal changes of temperature and humidity, (2) freedom 
from changes in battery potentials and resistances, (3) 
freedom from drifts, (4) need for only one potential, (5) ease 
of setting up and operating, (6) portability, and (7) low cost. 
The disadvantages are that (1) except with the torsion type 
the sensitivity is not as high as with the ordinary electrom- 
eter, (2) the sensitivity is not readily varied, and (3) it is 
not convenient to use a null method of reading. 

In Table I are listed the approximate characteristics of 
some instruments. The values of charge sensitivities listed 
are not the maximum attainable but represent those that

Useful techniques in electroscope and electrometer work. 
Mounting gold leaves. Gold leaf usually comes in sheets 
about 8 cm square, the leaves being separated by sheets of 
tissue paper. The leaf will be found quite uniform and thin 
enough so that objects can be distinguished through it 
when it is held before the eye. The thickness is usually 
about 0.08ju. The leaf is cut to the desired size by placing it 
between sheets of tissue pa- 
per and using a razor blade. 
The paper separating the 
gold leaf will be found satis- 
factory for the purpose. The 
cutting should be done on a 
flat base, such as cardboard. 
If the razor blade is sharp, 
the cut will be clean and the 
gold will not adhere to the 
paper. The leaf can be 
moved around from one sheet 




Fig. 19. 



Mounting the leaf on a gold- 
leaf electroscope. 



of paper to another by means of clean needles, mounted so 
that they can be handled with ease. It can also be picked 
up with clean fine-pointed tweezers. If the leaf touches any- 
thing which has a film of organic substance on the surface, it 
will easily adhere with only slight pressure. Once the leaf 
has stuck, it will usually tear before coming loose. It is 
safest to handle it as little as possible. When mounting the 
foil on the single-leaf type of electroscope, it is cut to size 
and then transferred to a piece of paper, such as typing paper, 
and placed so that one end of the leaf is near one edge of the 
paper. The edge of the paper is allowed to overhang the table 
about | inch. Some alcohol-dissolved shellac is spread across 
that part of the metal piece from which the leaf is to hang. 
The edge of this shellac must be perpendicular to the edge of 



256 ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES [Chap. VI 

the metal support, in order that the leaf, when mounted, will 
deflect in a plane perpendicular to the plane of this support. 
The metal piece must be clean, or the leaf is apt to adhere 
to it. The metal support is brought into position as shown 
in Fig. 19 and then lowered gradually. The paper will 
bend and the leaf will adhere to the shellac. 

The above operations should be carried out in a room in 
which the motion of the air is at a minimum. It is often 
advisable to wear a mask or deflector over the nose to avoid 
blowing the leaf about. 

Preparation of Wollaston wire. 18 The Hoffmann and many- 
string electrometers use a fine platinum suspension known 
as Wollaston wire. It may be obtained in various sizes 
from 1.5ju to 5^- To produce such a fine wire of uniform size, 
the following process of manufacture is used. Upon a much 
larger platinum wire is electroplated a uniform layer of 
silver. The combination is then drawn down until the fine 
thread of platinum in the middle is of the proper size. The 
silver is etched off with acid. Since the resulting platinum 
wire is quite delicate, special care must be used in the etching 
as well as in subsequent handling. 

In order to avoid small bubbles collecting on the wire and 
interfering with the etching, or in some cases breaking the 
fine wire, a special solution of chemically pure nitric acid in 
distilled water at a density of 1.10 g cm -3 is used. To insure 
uniform etching, the wire should be thoroughly cleaned 
before it is immersed in the acid. As an aid to handling after 
etching, a bead two to three times the diameter of the silver 
wire is formed on one end with a small oxygen flame before 
the silver is etched off. A section of wire is then cut off, 
perhaps an inch longer than the necessary suspension. The 
solution is placed in a tall vessel, such as a graduate, and the 
straightened silver wire is supported in it vertically. The 
suspension should be left in for a longer rather than a shorter 
time, since the platinum is not damaged by the solution. 

18 Wollaston wire is obtainable from Hartmann and Braun, A. G., Frank- 
furt am Main, Germany, and Baker and Company, Philadelphia. 



Chap. VI] ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES 257 

It is necessary that all the silver be etched off, or the sus- 
pension may be ruined in the annealing process. The small 
bead marks the lower end as the suspension is drawn from 
the solution. Before soldering it into place, it may be de- 
sirable to mount the suspension on a "wishbone," the dis- 
tance between the two prongs being somewhat greater than 
the length of the mounted suspension. If quartz fibers 20fx 
to SOfj. in diameter are mounted in the tips of the prongs and 
the Wollaston wire is fastened to these with a hard wax, 
there will be much less chance of breakage. 

Either before or after mounting, the suspension should be 
placed in a horizontal position and annealed with a small gas 
flame. In still air the flame is passed beneath at such a 
distance that the platinum is heated to a bright red color. 
If all the silver has been etched off, the suspension will 
appear a uniform brightness throughout its length. The 
annealing is necessary, if the wire is to be used in an elec- 
trometer, to relieve the strains which resulted from the 
drawing. 

In soldering the suspension in place, a c.p. solution of 
zinc chloride is a good flux. The heat is best applied with a 
small soldering iron, not directly at the point at which the 
suspension touches the solder but at a short distance away, 
relying upon the conductivity of the metal support. It is 
best to work under a magnifying glass or, better still, a 
binocular microscope. The joint should be rigidly inspected 
to see that the platinum is actually embedded in the solder 
and not just held by the solidified flux. 

Insulators used in electrometer and electroscope work. 
The insulator ordinarily used in electrometers is amber. 
The amber now on the market is usually a manufactured 
product which has as good insulation properties as the natu- 
ral amber and has the advantage of being obtainable in a 
variety of sizes. Amber has a high volume resistivity, and 
the surface resistance of clean amber is also high. If the 
surface is contaminated, the best remedy is to remove some 
of the amber with a clean tool by turning it in a lathe. If 



258 ELECTROMETERS, ELECTROSCOPES [Chap. VI 

this is not convenient, the amber may be covered with a thin 
coat of ceresin, as will be described later. 

The best insulator known is clean, dry, fused quartz. 
By clean quartz is meant quartz which has not touched 
anything since being heated to the softening point, and by 
dry quartz is meant quartz either in a good vacuum or in a 
gas dried by phosphorus pentoxide. Fused quartz is also 
superior to other insulators in that the soak-in is far less. 
Under comparable conditions amber has at least ten times 
the soak-in possessed by quartz. 

Ceresin is a natural wax which has remarkable electrical 
insulation properties. 19 It is about the same hardness as 
ordinary paraffin, each at 20°C. However, it has a some- 
what higher melting point than either paraffin or the arti- 
ficial ceresin, being liquid at 65 °C. Its insulation properties 
have been measured by Curtiss 20 of the Bureau of Standards. 
He gives the surface resistivity as greater than 10 17 ohm cm 
even at 90 per cent humidity. One of its main uses in the 
laboratory is to improve the surface resistance of other in- 
sulators. If the solid insulator and the ceresin are each 
heated to around 100°C. and a light coating of ceresin applied, 
the surface leakage will usually be found greatly reduced, 
sometimes by a factor of 100. 

19 Natural ceresin is distilled from the mineral ozokorite. An artificial 
ceresin, which is inferior to the natural product, is also on the market. In 
ordering, the natural product should be specified.
