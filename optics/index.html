Divisions of the spectrum. The electromagnetic spectrum 
divides naturally into the region for which the eye is sensitive, 
the infrared region, with frequencies below those which we 
perceive as red, and the ultraviolet region, with frequencies 
higher than those which we perceive as violet. These 
regions are defined roughly by the wave lengths given in 
Table I. In the text we will use microns for expressing wave 
length in the infrared and Angstroms for expressing wave 
length in the visible and ultraviolet. The visible region 
includes less than one octave of frequency, while the so-called 
infrared region embraces at least nine octaves and the ultra- 
violet embraces five or six octaves. 

Light sources. The sun. The sun naturally comes first 
in consideration of light sources. Its use is recommended

A heliostat or coelostat is required if a beam of sunlight is 
to be maintained in a fixed direction in the laboratory. 
Heliostats are obtainable from scientific supply companies.

be recoated on the front surface with aluminum if it is 
desired to obtain in the reflected sunlight the full range of

Tungsten lamps. Tungsten lamps are the most con- 
venient laboratory source of white light. Their efficiency is 
about 11 lumens/watt for the nitrogen-coiled filament type. 

The differences of spectral energy distribution of various 
tungsten-filament lamps are illustrated in Fig. 6, Chapter 
XI. The spectrum of emission of the filament is limited in 
the ultraviolet and infrared by the transmission of glass. 
With glass bulbs \ mm in thickness, the spectrum extends 
from about 3100 A in the ultraviolet to 3/x in the infrared.

Two tungsten lights convenient for many purposes in the 
laboratory are shown in Fig. 5. The one shown on the left is 
a projection lamp. It requires 6 volts and 18 amperes. An 
autotransformer or high-capacity storage battery serves as 
power source. The battery is, of course, preferred when con- 
stancy and steadiness of the emission are important. 1 The

lamp shown at the right has a straight filament. It is 
useful as a galvanometer lamp. Both of these lamps are 
obtainable commercially. 2 

A trade-mark on the end of 
a tungsten lamp bulb, when it 
interferes with the light emis- 
sion of the filament, may be 
removed by polishing with 
rouge and felt or with wet 
crocus cloth. 

A lamp 3 with a quartz bulb 
for absorption spectra is 
shown in Fig. 6. The bulb 
contains argon at 1^ atmos- 
pheres pressure. The tung- 
sten operates at about3100°C. 
and gives a continuous emission spectrum extending into the 
ultraviolet to 2500 A. At the operating temperature, the va- 
por pressure of tungsten is appreciable, and it would normally 

blacken the quartz part of 
the bulb. However, vertical 
convection currents of argon 
gas carry the evaporated 
tungsten molecules upward 
from the filament, so that 
they are not deposited on the 
quartz but rather on the up- 
per glass part of the bulb, 
where they do not impair the 
usefulness of the lamp.

fractory mantle was formerly

illumination and is now used in gasoline lamps. It is brought 
to incandescence in the outer hot surface zone of a Bunsen 
burner type of flame, where it assumes a temperature nearly as 
high as the Bunsen flame temperature. The mantle is com- 
posed of thorium oxide with 0.75 to 2.5 per cent cerium oxide 
added to increase its visible emissivity. This addition of ceri- 
um oxide plays much the same role as the sensitizer for a 
photographic plate ; that is, it introduces an absorption band 
in a desired spectral region without materially affecting the 
optical properties elsewhere. The effect of the cerium oxide is 
to make the emission in the green 30 percent greater than that 
of a black body at 1800 °C, whereas the emissions in the red 
and blue correspond closely to 1800°C. color temperature. 5 
The near infrared emissivity is less than 1 per cent from 0.7/x 
to about 6/*, and the incapacity of the mantle to radiate heatin 
this important region accounts for its high temperature. For 
the spectrum beyond 10/* the mantle again has an emissivity 
greater than 75 per cent. The mantle is an excellent labora- 
tory source for those long wave-length infrared radiations. 6 

Barnes suggests heating the mantle with a sharp oxygen 
flame striking it at a grazing angle. 7 This gives it a higher 
temperature, and also the elongated heated section produced 
is properly shaped for illuminating the slit of a spectrometer. 
More recently, Pfund has devised an arrangement to com- 
bine both electric and flame heating, allowing the attainment 
of even higher temperatures. 8 

Nernst glower. Nernst filaments are composed of zir- 
conium dioxide powder with about 15 per cent yttrium 
oxide powder. 9 For operation on alternating current, flex- 
ible platinum lead wires are later cemented to each end

of the refractory tube with a mixture of the oxide powders 
and zirconium chloride as a binder. For operation on direct 
current, the manner of attaching the electrodes is more 
complicated. The Nernst lamp normally operates at around 
2000 °K. Its spectrum extends well into the ultraviolet and 
infrared. However, beyond 15/* its emission is said to be 
inferior to the emission of the Globar heater. 

At one time the Nernst glower offered great promise for 
commercial lighting, owing to a luminous efficiency of 6 
lumens/watt as compared with 3 lumens/watt for the carbon 
filament. However, the modern incandescent lamp with a 
coiled tungsten filament in an atmosphere of nitrogen, having 
an efficiency of 11 lumens/watt, entirely changed matters. 
The use of the Nernst light is now confined to the laboratory. 
Here its usefulness depends upon the fact that it is operated 
in air and has a convenient form (cylinder 0.4 to 0.6 mm in 
diameter and 1 to 2 cm long) for focusing on the slit of a 
spectrometer. Griffith has 
described details of construc- 
tion for making Nernst fila- 
ments. 10 

Since the Nernst lamp has 
a negative temperature co- 
efficient of resistance, it must 
be stabilized with external re- 
sistance or, better, with a bal- 
last lamp having an iron-wire 
filament mounted in hydro- 
gen. 11 The iron wire of this 
lamp runs at a faint red glow; 
its remarkable current-stabilizing effect in an atmosphere of 
hydrogen at 30 to 100 millimeters pressure is shown in Fig. 7. 
Such a ballast lamp consumes 10 or 15 per cent of the total 
power needed for operating the Nernst filament.

Globars. The Globar is a rod of bonded silicon carbide 
about yV i ncn hi diameter and about 10 inches long. The 
ends fit into aluminum cup electrodes. A potential of 100 
volts across the rod brings it to an orange or yellow heat. It 
can be operated in air at a temperature above 1000°C, 

although at temperatures 
around 2000°C. the carbide 
dissociates and carbon is va- 
porized or oxidized, leaving 
silicon, or, in the presence of 
air, silicon dioxide. A protec- 
tive layer of thorium dioxide 
sintered to the outside of the 
Globar with thorium chlo- 
ride as binder will allow of 
temperatures in excess of 
2000°C. 12 A suitable mount- 
ing for the Globar is shown 
in Fig. 8. 

Carbon arcs. The carbon arc 
is useful as a laboratory light 
source. Ordinarily, the posi- 
tive carbon is mounted hori- 
zontally. An 8-mm positive 
carbon is consumed at the 
same rate as a 6-mm vertical 
negative carbon. Accordingly, 
if carbons of this size are used, they may be fed into the arc 
automatically by clockwork. 

The carbon arc requires at least 40 volts to operate it. 
Higher voltage increases the size of the positive crater with- 
out materially affecting its surface temperature. 

The character of the light emission from the ordinary 
carbon arc may be influenced by the addition of metallic 
salts as cores in the carbons. (Magnesium fluoride is often 
used to get a white arc.) The spectral distribution of the

carbon arc with cored carbons is illustrated in Fig. 9. This 
is a curve of galvanometer deflections against wave length, 
as determined with a quartz monochromator (shown in 
Fig. 32) and cesium oxide photocell. (See Chapter X.) 
The slit widths were the same for all wave lengths. This 
curve does not correct for the transmission of the image- 
forming lens (shown in Fig. 5, Chapter XI) which was used 
to focus the light. Without this lens the spectrum would 
have extended well into the ultraviolet.

The ordinary carbon arc has a crater brightness of about 
13,000 candles/cm 2 and an efficiency of about 35 lumens/ 
watt. The Sperry Gyroscope Company has produced an 
arc that uses special shields to confine the current to a definite 
boundary around the rotating crater. 13 This arc is about 
six times as bright as the ordinary arc. 

Lummer has succeeded in obtaining extreme temperatures 
in the carbon arc by operating it in an inert atmosphere

under high pressure. Under a pressure of 22 atmospheres 
he was able to obtain temperatures of 7600 °K., considerably 
in excess of the solar surface temperature. The surface 
brightness reported for this temperature was 280,000 can- 
dles/cm 2 . The attainment of such temperatures and bright- 
ness is difficult. 

A technique of measuring. For the preliminary study of a 
spectrum plate, a technique of measuring and recording data 

which is neat and avoids con- 
fusion is illustrated in Fig. 10. 
This procedure employs an 
enlarged print of the original 
spectrum plate to identify the 
iron or other reference lines 
appearing in the eyepiece of 
the comparator. To facilitate 
this identification, the wave 
lengths of the iron lines are 
written in the margin of the 
print. Also, the print serves 
as a permanent record of the 
appearance of the spectrum as 
well as a record of the data of 
measurement. 

First, the wave lengths of 
conspicuous iron comparison 
lines, which are to be used as reference lines in the measure- 
ment, are written in the margin. The original plate has the 
same appearance in the eyepiece of the comparator as the 
enlarged print; thus it easily serves to identify the com- 
parison lines. After the wave length of each unknown line 
is determined by interpolation, it is recorded on the clear 
margin of the print as shown at the left in Fig. 10. Notes 
may also be added in this margin when the wave lengths are 
later identified by reference to Kayser's tables. 14

Iron arcs. The iron arc is used in the laboratory by the 
spectroscopist as a source of ultraviolet light and also as a 
standard comparison source. Its spectrum has been thor- 
oughly studied, and the wave lengths of the lines, as well as 
the influence of pole and pressure effects on them, are well 
known. 15 

An iron arc developed by Pfund 16 suitable for use in the 
laboratory is shown in Fig. 11. An iron oxide bead is 
placed on the lower electrode for stabilizing the arc. If the

upper electrode is a graphite rod, the arc is even more stable 
than it is with an iron electrode. 17 The arc can be started 
by rubbing a carbon across the gap. 

Low-pressure mercury arcs. The low-pressure mercury 
arc is a convenient laboratory light source. 18 It gives several 
strong lines in the visible, ultraviolet, and near infrared 

15 See the following: 

Babcock, Harold D., Astrophys. J., 66, 256 (1927), 67, 240 (1928).

16 Pfund, A. H., Astrophys. J., 27, 298 (1908). 

17 The National Carbon Company produces a spectroscopic grade of pure 
graphite. The pure carbon arc exhibits only one line in the visible or the 
ultraviolet spectrum. This line is 2478 A.

H., Astrophys. J., 27, 299 (1908).

spectra. These lines are far enough apart to be separated 
with filters. (See Table XI.) 

The ultraviolet spectrum of the arc in a fused quartz tube 
extends to about 2000 A. The energy at the extreme short 
wave-length limit produces ozone in the air. The ozone 
formation, however, becomes weaker and weaker as the lamp 
is burned, owing to changes in the transmission limit of the 
quartz. Finally the ozone formation practically ceases. 
Baly has found that such changed quartz will emit a green 
phosphorescence and will regain its original transparency if 
it is heated in the blast burner. 19 

The Cooper-Hewitt type of mercury light has a brightness 
of about 2.3 candles/cm 2 . The ordinary Cooper-Hewitt 
illuminating lamp has a tube 4 feet long and about 1 inch in 
diameter. It is a convenient light source for many experi- 
ments when an extended source is desired, as for observing 
Haidinger's and Newton's fringes. To get uniform illumi- 
nation over an extended area, drafting linen is hung below 
the lamp. 

In glass the Cooper-Hewitt lamp does not, of course, emit 
all of the ultraviolet spectrum. Recently this arc has been 
put on the market, made with a tube of Corex red-purple 
glass which suppresses the visible radiation (except 4046) 
and transmits the near ultraviolet. In this form it is excel- 
lent for therapeutic use. 

The commercial hot quartz vacuum arc is much more 
brilliant (350 candles/cm 2 ) than the Cooper-Hewitt lamp 
discussed above. The ordinary hot quartz lamp is not of a 
convenient form for use in the laboratory, but it is now avail- 
able in the form of a vertical straight quartz tube constructed 
especially for laboratory use. 20 These laboratory arcs are 
equipped with rectifiers, so that they may be operated on 
either alternating or direct current.

High-pressure mercury arcs. Harries and Hippel 21 have 
described a high-pressure mercury lamp which is now com- 
mercially available. 22 This is illustrated by Fig. 12. The 
lamp is mounted in a nearly light-tight case — a very conven- 
ient construction for use in the laboratory. The lamp is 
made of uviol glass or quartz, with or without added cad- 
mium to obtain the red cadmium 6438 A line. Schott glass 
filters are also supplied for isolating the yellow, green, blue, 
violet, or ultraviolet lines. 

The spectrum of the high-pressure lamp exhibits con- 
siderable continuous background. Accordingly, the spectral

purity obtainable with it by the use of filters is not as great 
as it is with the low-pressure arc. The emission, however, is 
very steady, especially when the lamp is operated on storage 
batteries. 

Cornelius Bol of Stanford University (formerly of the 
Philips Laboratory, Eindhoven, Holland) has developed a

which produces the high pressure is started, however, by 
argon at a pressure of 2 or 3 cm of mercury. The operating 
potential for the lamp is around 500 volts. Heat generated 
by the argon discharge volatilizes the liquid mercury exposed 
in the lamp until a pressure of mercury gas of about 200 
atmospheres is attained. On account of the high ultimate 
pressure, the lamp must be made of a thick-walled capillary 
tube as shown in Fig. 13. The tungsten electrodes project 
beyond the reserve mercury in order to guide the discharge 
down the central part of the tube. In the center, tempera-

than the brightness of molten tungsten are attained. For 
example, a lamp operating on 640 volts at a pressure of 
200 atmospheres has a brightness of 180,000 candles/cm 2 
and a luminous efficiency of 79 lumens/watt. The emission 
of a Bol lamp is shown in Fig. 9. (See also Table II.) 

The inside surface of the quartz capillary probably attains 
a temperature in excess of the critical temperature of mer- 
cury, so that no liquid mercury can condense. The mercury- 
gas envelope around the hot central core of the arc absorbs 
the resonance line emitted in the core, and at the obtaining 
pressure and temperature the resonance line is so broad that 
its absorption extends over the major part of the ultraviolet 
spectrum (to 2700 A). 

The electrodes are sealed in the Bol lamp with a new 



Chap. IX] OPTICS 355 

glass. A lamp of convenient size for use in the laboratory 
has the electrodes spaced 1 cm apart. It is first filled with 
2 cm pressure of gaseous argon and then with liquid mercury 
until the 30-mil tungsten wires project about § mm beyond 
the mercury at each end. A 640-volt transformer is suitable 
for operating the light. It is connected in series with the arc 
and a suitable choke coil. When the arc is shorted out, the

A "cold," low-pressure mercury-vapor lamp is shown in 
Fig. 14. 25 This lamp employs a few millimeters pressure of 
hydrogen, argon, or one of the other noble gases as a starting 
gas. Heat developed by the discharge in the noble gas soon 
distills mercury vapor from small globules of the liquid metal.

The potential for operating the lamp is obtained from a sign 
transformer or from a storage battery and spark coil. This 
lamp is only about one tenth as brilliant in the visible as the 
Harries and Hippel lamp, but its emission at 2536 A is many- 
fold greater. In fact, about 80 per cent of its total emission 
is in the resonance line. 

The resonance line from the mercury lamp shown in 
Fig. 14 is so strong that the mercury vapors, rising from a 
globule of liquid mercury held in the hand, cast a strong 
shadow on a fluorescent screen. 26 With a 3-mm Corex red- 
purple filter to suppress the visible spectrum, this lamp is 
ideal for exciting the fluorescence of minerals. 

This type of mercury light is very useful in the laboratory. 

24 The Bol lamp must be operated surrounded with a stream of cool- 
ing water. 

25 This lamp is obtainable from the Reed and Miller Company, 16 South 
Raymond Street, Pasadena, California.

When neon is used instead of argon as the starting gas, this 
single source yields a series of strong lines well distributed 
over the spectral range from 2536 A to 10,140 A. The gap 
in the mercury spectrum between 6907 A and 10,140 A is 
filled by a series of neon fines around 8300 A. 27 

Filters for use with the various mercury arcs to yield 
monochromatic light are discussed in a later section. 

Other gaseous discharges. Commercial sodium arcs are 
now available. They are confined in a special glass con- 
tainer that is not attacked by the metal vapor. 28 These arcs 
operate inside a clear Dewar flask and afford a large-area 
source of monochromatic light which is particularly suited 
to many laboratory tests and demonstrations. The char- 
acteristics of this and the Bol lamp are given in Table II.

the alkali metal, and they may be used for experiments in 
which sodium, at higher temperatures and pressures, is to be 
confined behind windows transparent to both the ultraviolet 
spectrum and the infrared spectrum. 30 

The ultraviolet spectrum obtained from a hydrogen dis- 
charge tube is continuous, extending from the short wave- 
length emission limit of incandescent tungsten toward shorter 
wave lengths to the limit of transmission of quartz. This 
hydrogen continuum is most effectively excited by sources of 
the type developed by Duffendack and Manley, Smith and 
Fowler, Munch, and Jacobi. 31 These sources excite the 
spectrum with thermoelectrons emitted from a hot cathode. 

Capillary discharge tubes 
filled with many different 
elementary gases are now 
available commercially. 32 

Sparks. To obtain the 
spark spectrum characteris- 
tic of the materials com- 
posing the electrodes, it is 
necessary to use a condenser 
of sufficient capacity to 
give an explosively noisy 
spark. Either a transformer or an induction coil can be 
used as the source of potential. A spark between mag-

Fig. 15, is useful for shadow photographs of bullets in motion, 
and so forth, and for the photography of sound waves by the 
Schlieren-methode. 33 The duration of the illumination from 
the magnesium spark can be made extremely short. 

Flames. Flames such as the Bunsen flame, which are 
almost colorless, give characteristic emission spectra when 
volatile metallic vapors are introduced. The metals most 
commonly used to obtain monochromatic or nearly mono- 
chromatic light are given in

Sodium light may be ob-

Bunsen burner tube. An- 
other method of introducing 
the salts into the flame is il- 
lustrated by the device shown 
in Fig. 16. A neodymium fil- 
ter may be used to absorb the 
emission of sodium vapor and 
at the same time transmit the 
red emission lines from po- 
tassium or lithium vapors. To obtain the metallic thallium 
spectrum, a bead of the metal, fused in a platinum-wire loop, 
is touched to the edge of the Bunsen flame. The bead is 
introduced just far enough to obtain the desired rate of evapo- 
ration. If the bead is held too far inside the flame, it boils 
away rapidly. Inasmuch as thallium is a poisonous metal, a 
high concentration of the vapors in the room should not be 
allowed. Also, sodium, potassium, and lithium vapors may 
be introduced into a Meker burner flame by placing a small 
globule of fused sodium chloride, potassium chloride, or 
lithium chloride on the grill of the Meker burner.

The ultraviolet. The portion of the ultraviolet spectrum 
treated here will be limited to the wave-length range 2000A 
to 4000 A. 34 In the long-wave half of this region between

ing mica, celluloid, diamond, Canada balsam, ether, glycerin,

acetone, turpentine, xylene, and in thin layers, many ordi- 
nary glasses. (See Table IV.) For the entire region from 
4000 A to 2000 A the list of materials is not so great. It 
includes rock salt, potassium chloride, fluorite, magnesia, 
lithium fluoride, alum, gypsum, sugar, calc-spar, water, 
ethyl alcohol, glacial acetic acid, liquid ammonia, fused and 
crystalline quartz, and cellophane. (For the transmission of 
cellophane see Table V.) 

Prisms, lenses, and mirrors for the ultraviolet. Only 
a few of the substances mentioned above are suitable for 
making prisms and lenses. Fluorite and quartz make excel- 
lent prisms. They can be combined to make achromatic 
lenses. But the scarcity of fluorite of good optical quality in 
large sizes makes these achromats very expensive. A combi- 
nation of quartz and rock salt is sometimes used for making 
achromats. Recently, synthetic alkali halides and mag- 
nesium oxide have become available in large pieces, and 
these, together with other synthetic substances, will no 
doubt become important for constructing ultraviolet optics.

Filters for the ultraviolet. Thin metal films are among 
the most interesting filters for the ultraviolet. The trans- 
mission band exhibited by silver and the alkali metals is 
associated with a gap lying between the region where the 
reflection is ascribed to the effect of free electrons (on the 
long wave-length side of the gap), and the region where 
reflection is ascribed to bound electrons (on the short wave- 
length side). In silver, this gap at 3160 A is approximately 
100 A wide. It is much wider than this for the alkali metal 
films. 

Potassium films may be used as a filter for isolating ultra- 
violet radiations. The full transmission of potassium in the 
ultraviolet begins at 3000 A for films of a thickness just 
sufficient to be opaque in the visible to sunlight. R. W. 
Wood has studied this phenomenon and describes how these 
films can be formed on a quartz-glass bulb cooled to liquid 
air temperatures. 35 Unfortunately, films prepared as he 
describes are only permanent at temperatures considerably 
below room temperature. O'Bryan, however, has shown 
how potassium may be deposited between quartz-glass plates 
to give films permanent even at the elevated temperature of

boiling water. 36 The transmission of these thicker films 
begins at about 3350 A, becomes about 25 per cent at 
2500 A, and decreases to a little below this value as the wave 
length 2000 A is approached. The transmission of such a 
potassium film is illustrated by Fig. 17.

Bromine vapor can also be used as a filter. It is trans- 
parent to the ultraviolet rays. A layer of saturated bromine 
vapor 5 cm thick at room temperature is opaque to blue 
light and nearly opaque to green light, as one can readily see 
by interposing a bottle containing a little liquid bromine

The ultraviolet transmission limit for mica is at about 
2800 A for 0.01 mm thickness. Mica of this thickness is 
completely opaque at wave lengths below 2600 A. 

The transmissions in the ultraviolet of some other ma- 
terials are illustrated in Figs. 18 and 19. 

Polarization of the ultraviolet. The new sheet polarizers 39 
made of herapathite are opaque to ultraviolet light. (See 
Fig. 38.) Although the calcite of Nicol prisms is trans- 
parent to 2000 A, the Canada balsam used for cementing 
them is not transparent in the ultraviolet at wave lengths 
below about 3000 A. For cementing optical surfaces to be 
used in the ultraviolet, glycerin, castor oil, or dextrose sugar 
should be used. A Wollaston prism may be used to polarize 
light in the ultraviolet when its parts are properly cemented. 

The infrared. The infrared spectrum extends from 
7600 A, or 0.76/t, to about 400/i. A thermopile or radiom- 
eter is generally used for measuring infrared radiation. As 
the operation of these instruments depends on thermal 
effects produced by the radiation, the infrared spectrum is 
often referred to as the heat spectrum. The infrared radia- 
tions are emitted by heated bodies. Ordinarily, heated 
bodies are used as laboratory sources for the infrared spec- 
trum. 

It is convenient to divide the heat spectrum into three 
regions: The near infrared, from 1.1/j, to 20/jl; the inter- 
mediate infrared, from 20 jjl to 40/t; and the far infrared, 
from 40/* to 400/4. The spectroscopic significance of the 
near infrared is that the characteristic frequencies of gases 
which fall in this region generally arise from molecular 
oscillations, whereas the characteristic frequencies which fall 
in the visible and ultraviolet regions arise in general from 
electronic oscillations. On the other hand, in the far infra- 
red the characteristic frequencies of gases arise from mo- 
lecular rotation and molecular bending. In the case of 
crystals the characteristic frequencies in the near infrared

are generally interatomic oscillations within the chemical 
radicals that exist as units in the crystal, while frequencies 
in the far infrared are due to oscillations of the positive ions 
(or radicals) of the crystals relative to the negative ones. 

The intermediate infrared spectral region from 20^t to 40/x 
was formerly closed to investigation on account of the lack of 
transparent substances to be used for making windows and 
prisms. There are now available, however, a transparent 
paraffin of high melting point, 40 and large synthetic crystals 
of the alkali halides which are transparent in the range 20(i 
to 40m- 41

Materials useful for windows on absorption cells and

such material. Although it is quite opaque in the visible, 
soot is translucent for the heat spectrum.

Quartz (for the ordinary ray) exhibits two strong bands, one 
at 8.9/1 and one at 20.8/1. Rock salt has only one band, 
at 52/i. 

Multiple reflections from crystals are employed to isolate 
narrow bands of monochromatic radiation from the heat 
spectrum. For example, if the spectrum from a heated 
body is reflected once from a rock-salt crystal surface, the 
energy at wave lengths about 52/i are reflected while those 
radiations elsewhere, especially in the short-wave spectrum, 
where the reflection is nonmetallic, are attenuated about

twenty times. In spite of this attenuation by a single 
reflection, the energy in the 52/x band may still be much less 
than the integrated energy reflected at other wave lengths. 
After a second reflection, however, the short-wave spectrum 
is again attenuated about twenty times, or four hundred 
times altogether, while the energy in the band of waves 
around 52/j. is little affected. Accordingly, after four or 
five reflections the only radiations remaining, the so-called 
residual rays, are those of the 52/x band. 

The use of these successive reflections is a standard pro- 
cedure for obtaining monochromatic bands of radiation in 
the far infrared. The crystals used for obtaining various 
wave lengths are listed in Table VIII. We shall describe 
the apparatus used for obtaining residual rays in a later part 
of this chapter.

the color for which the indices of refraction of the liquid and

This limitation is a serious one. For example, when the 
filter is to be used in conjunction with a highly selective 
receiver, such as a photocell, the response of the receiver for 
rays weakly transmitted by the filter but for which the 
receiver is exceptionally sensitive (or for which the emission 
of the source is especially strong) may seriously interfere 
with the interpretation of the results obtained. Another 
limitation of this filter is its sensitivity to temperature 
changes. Because of this, the filter cannot be used effec- 
tively in an intense beam of light such as sunlight, owing to 
temperature gradients set up in the cell. 

However, the dependence of the transmitted wave length 
upon temperature may be put to use. F. Weigert and 



Chap. IX]

collaborators have found, for example, that a cell made of 
particles of crown glass immersed in liquid methyl benzoate 
transmitted red light at 18°C. (64°F.) and blue light at 50°C. 
(122°F.). 47 

A very interesting Christiansen filter effect is exhibited by 
the infrared transmission of thin powder films. 48 Their 
maximum of transmission occurs at the wave length at 
which the index of the powder is unity or equal to the index 
of the surrounding medium. For magnesia this transmission 
maximum in air is at 12.2/*, and if the filter is immersed in 
carbon tetrachloride, the maximum shifts to wave length 9/x, 
at which both the carbon tetrachloride and the magnesia 
have the same index. 

Reflection of metals. Of the metals useful in the visible 
spectrum for reflection of light, the three most important 
are aluminum, speculum, and silver. Their reflectivities are 
shown in Fig. 30. It is to be noted that aluminum is

so to speak). 

Monochromators. The best method of isolating a narrow 
wave-length band of high spectral purity from a source of 
white light is to use a double monochromator, that is, two 
single monochromators built together. High spectral purity 
is often desirable for highly selective effects, such as, for 
example, the determination of the long wave-length limit of 
the photoelectric effect, or in any other case when the slight 
spectral impurity that one might have with a single mono- 
chromator would vitiate the results of the measurement. A 



Chap. IX] 



OPTICS 



377 



step can be made in the direction of high spectral purity by 
the use of filters in series with a single monochromator. 
These filters are, however, usually less efficient than a single 
monochromator. The transmission of a single monochrom- 
ator is about 45 per cent.

which will function in the ultraviolet. Generally, mono- 
chromators employ quartz lenses. These are brought to 
focus with a mechanism operated by the wave-length drum. 
Fig. 32 shows how this is accomplished in the Hilger-Miiller 
double monochromator by the use of a cam bar mounted on 
the prism table. As the prism table and lens system move 
as a unit toward the slit system, the lenses are brought into 
focus for shorter and shorter wave lengths. The cam bar is

so constructed that it causes the wave lengths to fall on the 
exit slits for which the lenses are in focus. 

Use of mirrors in monochromators. Parabolic mirrors are 
often used in monochromators, because an optical system 
using mirrors is achromatic. However, mirrors have the 
distinct disadvantage as compared with lenses that the 
parallel collimated beam is returned in the direction of the 
entrance slit, a direction which precludes a neat simple 
arrangement of the other optical parts. To use a mirror on

its optical axis requires either an auxiliary flat as in the 
Pfund 49 arrangement shown in Fig. 33(a) or an off-axis 
mirror as shown in Fig. 33(b). One way to make such an 
off-axis mirror is to construct a large ordinary paraboloidal 
mirror and cut out the desired mirror from one side of it. 

A mirror system composed of spherical mirrors like the 
one shown in Fig. 33(c) may be used. This, of course, 
introduces large distortions in the wave front. It is possible, 
however, by proper orientation of a similarly imperfect

The optical train in monochromators is usually either the 
Littrow arrangement or the Wadsworth arrangement, both 
of which use the prism at minimum deviation. These 
arrangements are shown in Fig. 35. 61 

Water monochromator. An ultraviolet monochromator 
with improvised optics, devised by Harrison, 62 is shown in 
Fig. 36. The optical parts consist of a water prism and a 
spherical aluminized mirror. This monochromator is very 
simple, and optically it is good enough for isolating the 
stronger mercury lines (as the illustration of the produced 
spectrum shows). It has a relatively high aperture, //6. 
The dispersions of crystal quartz, fused quartz, and water 
are related as 25:21:19 at 3000 A. Since water is more 
transparent to the ultraviolet than quartz, this mono- 
chromator can be used for isolating wave lengths as short as 
1820 A.

Focal isolation. Fig. 37 shows the method of focal isola- 
tion invented by Wood to isolate the far infrared radiations 
from a Welsbach burner. 63 When the first lens is positioned 
in relation to the light source at a distance equal to twice its 
focal length for the far infrared rays, where the index of 
refraction is 2.25, the near infrared rays emerging from the 
lens are divergent. An opaque spot at the center of the 
quartz lens prevents the direct transmission of the median 
near infrared rays through the aperture provided at the focus 
of the far infrared rays. Usually two lenses are arranged 
in series of effect complete separation of the far infrared 
rays. 

A focal isolation method has been applied to the isolation

Residual-ray isolation. Apparatus using the residual-ray 
method for the isolation of wave lengths in the infrared is 
illustrated in Fig 38. 65 The apparatus shown at the top of this 
figure employs four crystal reflections, while the one at the 
bottom, placed at the focus of an image-forming mirror, uses 
only two crystal reflections. 

When the two-crystal apparatus is equipped for 6.7/x 
(crystals of calcite) it is useful for measuring humidity, since 
this region of the spectrum is very sensitive to moisture in the 
radiation path. On the other hand, with either quartz, 
Carborundum, or potassium chromate crystals, which give 
bands of radiation at 8.7/x, 12/t, and 11.6^1, respectively, the 
instrument is useful as a radiation pyrometer insensitive 
both to water vapor and to light smoke or haze. In the 
region from 8/x. to lSfi there is very little absorption by the

spectrum the entire thickness of the atmosphere exhibits a 
transmission comparable to the transmission of the atmos- 
phere for green and yellow light (T = 85 per cent). 

Polarization. There are now new polarizers available for 
use in the visible spectrum, but they are not as efficient as 
Nicol prisms. 66 The transmission of these polarizers, shown 
in Fig. 39, does not yield as high efficiency as that of a Nicol 
prism. For plane-polarized light of proper azimuth a Nicol 
prism transmits about 80 per cent. Two Nicol prisms in

series transmit a maximum of about 32 per cent of un- 
polarized white light. At the other extreme, two Nicol 
prisms accurately crossed are quite opaque. For example, 
they will not transmit enough sunlight to make the disk of 
the sun discernible. However, to obtain this degree of 
opacity, the Nicol prisms must be crossed very precisely (to 
an accuracy of the order of 1 second of arc). 

The new polarizers have the advantage over Nicol prisms 
that they can polarize a beam of greater aperture (both areal 
and angular). Two applications of the new polarizers are 
illustrated in Figs. 40 and 41. 

One of these, illustrated in Fig. 40, applies to the measure- 
ment of strain in glass. Objects to be tested for strain, as,

plate is described below.) When a full-wave plate is placed 
in front of the analyzer, slight variations of the polarization 
over the field of view are manifest as variations of color from

Engineering applications of polarized light. The property 
of isotropic transparent materials that a strain makes them

ment for such studies using spherical mirrors and the new 
polarizers is shown in Fig. 41. The astigmatism (due to 
using the mirrors off axis) can be balanced out, at least in 
part, by tipping the camera lens about a horizontal axis by a 
suitable amount. The model of the shape to be tested is 
usually made from a clear sheet of Bakelite or Marblette.

The quarter-wave plates are used in the illustrated ar- 
rangement to allow the elimination of the pattern of iso- 
clinics (the lines along which the principal stress in the 
specimen has a constant inclination) from the pattern of 
isochromatics (the lines along which the quantity (p — q) 
has a constant value). Here p and q are the principal 
stresses produced in the model by the applied loading. 
Methods of determining the magnitude of the quantities 
p and q from the measured isoclinics and isochromatics can- 
not be described here, since they are quite complicated. 58

However, in spite of this, the experimental method of study- 
ing the stresses in many structures is easier than the theo- 
retical method, and the experimental method has the advan- 
tage over the theoretical method that it carries with it the 
conviction of a more direct appeal to nature for the informa- 
tion desired. 

Quarter-, half-, and full-wave plates. Quarter-, half-, and 
full- wave plates are made of quartz, selenite, or mica cut or 
split parallel to the optical axis. The thickness of the plate 
is made such that the relative retardation of the ordinary 
and extraordinary ray is f , \, or 1 full wave length. The 
thickness r required for a quarter-wave plate is

lines is about 0.036 mm. Although for mica the quantity 
(n e —n„) varies from specimen to specimen, 59 it can be taken 
as essentially constant for all wave lengths. Therefore, 
the thickness of a quarter-wave plate is roughly proportional 
to the wave length for which it is intended.

388 OPTICS [Chap. IX 

A quarter-wave plate, when it is set perpendicular to a 
beam of polarized light with its principal directions at 45° to 
the azimuth of polarization, retards one half of the polarized 
light until its phase is 90° behind the phase of the other half, 
thus producing circular polarized light. Conversely, a 
quarter-wave plate will change circular to plane-polarized 
light. A half-wave plate, similarly oriented, transforms 
plane-polarized light to plane-polarized light rotated in 
azimuth by 90°. 

The principal directions of mica are determined by inter- 
posing it between crossed Nicols. The principal directions 
are parallel and at right angles to the azimuth of polarization 
of the incident light when the mica (of any thickness) is so 
oriented that it does not affect the cutoff of the second Nicol. 

Tutton's test 60 for distinguishing between the two principal 
directions in a quarter-wave plate is to place the plate be- 
tween crossed Nicols (with its plane perpendicular to the 
axis of the beam of incident white polarized light) oriented in 
an azimuth such that the restored light is a maximum. The 
principal directions in the plate now make angles of 45° with 
the azimuth of vibration of the incident polarized light. The 
mica plate is rotated first about one principal direction and 
then about the other, so that, in each case, light traverses a 
thicker layer of mica. In one case the color passes from 
bluish gray through iron gray to black, and in the other case 
the color passes from white to yellow and then through colors 
of a higher order. The latter color sequence corresponds to 
rotation about the principal direction of slower vibration in 
the mica and the first case corresponds to the principal direc- 
tion of faster vibration in the mica. 

Splitting of mica. Quarter-wave plates are most easily 
made from mica, since it is easily split to the thickness 
required. 

The stock sheets are split from clear mica plates. 61 The

starting sheet is trimmed to about 3 inches square with sharp 
tin snips so as to have clean edges. (The exact size of the 
starting sheet is immaterial.) One corner of the starting 
sheet is then frayed out by rubbing it, and a clean dissecting 
needle is introduced to divide the sheet approximately in 
half. A drop of water is introduced in the cavity so pro- 
duced. 62 The mica is then split all around the edges by 
working the needle along, point first, at an angle of about 30°, 
so that the first cleavage starts inside the boundary of the 
sheet. This avoids a terraced cleavage. After the needle 
has gone around the circumference, a second drop of water 
is introduced, and the plates are drawn apart. The water so 
facilitates cleavage that the sheets may be separated almost 
as easily as the pages of a book. This process is repeated 
until the thickness is approximately 0.036 mm or as thin as 
desired. Each time, the sheet is divided so as to give two 
sheets of approximately the same thickness. 

Mica gauges. 63 A gauge may be made up as shown in 
Fig. 42. To make such a gauge the principal directions are

If inches, and so forth. (See Fig. 42.) The strips are next 
cemented (with balsam) between glass plates as illustrated, 
care being exercised to see that none of the strips are mounted 
upside down or rotated end for end. The steps so formed 
are then indexed. 

The retardation per step of the gauge is determined as 
follows : After the analyzer is set for maximum transmission 

of the light, the gauge is 
placed on the mirror of the 
Norremberg doubler (see Fig. 
43) either parallel or perpen- 
dicular to the azimuth of po- 
larization. A sodium light 
should be used for illumina- 
tion. The index number of 
the step which gives opacity 
is noted. The step giving 
opacity is a quarter-wave 
plate for the D lines. Other 
steps are proportionately 
greater and less. 

Using the gauge. The gauge 
is used as follows : First, the 
analyzing Nicol of the Nor- 
remberg doubler is set for ex- 
tinction. The mica of unknown thickness is placed on the 
bottom mirror of the doubler, with its principal direction mak- 
ing an angle of 45° with the azimuth of polarization to give 
maximum transmission. Then the gauge strip is laid on top 
of the mica so that it is either parallel or perpendicular to the 
azimuth of polarization. At one of these orientations, the 
steps show "interference" colors, and at the other, and proper 
one, opacity is obtained for one or two of the steps. The 
calibration value of the step which gives opacity corresponds 
to the retardation of the mica sample. Interpolation may 
be required to make a delicate measurement.

Magnification of lenses. The transverse magnification of 
a lens is the ratio of image diameter to object diameter, or, 
expressed another way, it is the ratio of transverse image 
displacement to transverse object displacement. For a 
simple lens the magnification is given by the ratio of image 
distance to object distance. For a system such as a spectrom- 
eter, which has a collimating element (lens or mirror) with 
the object at or near its focal plane and a telescope element 
also with the image at or near its focal plane, the magnifica- 
tion produced is the ratio of the focal length of the telescope 
element to that of the collimating element. 

Another case, encountered in a telescope, is that in which 
parallel light is received by the objective and observed by an 
eyepiece adjusted so that its focal plane is very near the focus 
of the objective. Here, the angular magnifying power is the 
ratio of the focal length of the objective to that of the eye- 
piece. 

The longitudinal magnification of an image-forming sys- 
tem gives the ratio of the displacement of the image along 
the optical axis to the displacement of the object. In the 
case of a system composed of two lenses (or mirrors) with 
the object and image at or near the respective focal planes of 
these elements, the longitudinal magnification is given by 
the square of the ratio of the focal lengths. 

Other properties of lenses. When a beam of parallel light 
is focused with a thin lens on the optical axis, its focal length 
/ is given by the expression 

where n and r 2 are the respective radii of curvature of the 
two surfaces of the lens, and n is the index of refraction of 
the material from which the lens is constructed. The r's are 
taken positive if the curvature acts to converge the light. 

If the light is inclined to the optical axis of the lens, it 
exhibits astigmatism as shown in Fig. 44. For example, the 
best focus of a distant star, which would be a small hard spot 



392 



OPTICS 



[Chap. IX 



of light on the optical axis, is a soft image when the lens is 
inclined. The diameter of the smallest image is known as 
the "circle of least confusion." Within the focal distance 
giving the smallest off-axis image, the lens gives at one 
particular distance a rather sharp line focus, which is per- 
pendicular to the plane passing through the image and the 
optical axis. Also, outside this image another rather sharp 
line focus is obtained. This line focus is perpendicular to 
the first line and parallel to the plane referred to above.

conjugate real focii, and hyperboloidal for two conjugate 
focii, one of which is virtual. The spherical mirror is, of 
course, suited for focusing light from a source at its center of 
curvature exactly back on 
the center. 

When a spherical mirror 
of radius R is used to focus 
parallel light striking it at 
an angle, the image ex- 
hibits astigmatism, and the 
lines corresponding to the 
two circles shown in Fig. 44, 
determined by the positions 
of the astigmatic images, 
are a circle of diameter R 
and a straight line, respec- 
tively. (See Fig. 21, Chap-

that a simple optical system with a single lens in front of the 
galvanometer mirror will give as much illumination on the 
recording film, on a basis of equal resolving power, as any 
other possible stigmatic system. Furthermore, he points 
out that the focal length of the simple systems should be 
chosen so that the limit to the resolving power is set by the 
photographic material rather than by interference effects. 
Although 25 lines/mm or more can be resolved by photog- 
raphy, Hardy sets an arbitrary practical limit of 0.1 mm as 
the resolving power of the photographic material. To ob- 
tain maximum illumination and at the same time to conserve 
on the use of photographic materials, the simple lens should 
be chosen to give a spot at least 0.1 mm wide.

However, by using an astigmatic optical system such as 
the one shown in Fig. 47, it is easily possible to obtain nine 
times as much illumination as with the simple lens. Further- 
more, the astigmatic system has the additional advantage 
that rotation of the galvanometer mirror about a hori- 
zontal axis does not produce a vertical deflection of the 
image on the recording film. 

The calculation of the maximum velocity at which the 
recording spot can traverse the photographic emulsion and 
still yield a perceptible trace is treated in Chapter XI. 



Chap. IX] OPTICS 395 

This treatment includes the astigmatic case illustrated in 
Fig. 47. Owing to the recent developments in fast photo- 
graphic emulsions, the data given in Table VI, Chapter XI, 
for the various materials may be regarded as being dis- 
tinctly conservative.
