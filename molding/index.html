CHAPTER XV 

Molding and Casting 

BY 
ROGEE HAYWARD 

T)ROCEDURE in molding and casting metals has changed 
-*- very little since the beginning of history. There have 
been changes in the attendant mechanism, but the essential 
methods are the same as those used by prehistoric man. 
Because the casting of metals seemed a wonderful thing to 
those who did not practice the art, those who did guarded 
jealously the details of their craft, lest others find out how 
easy it was. 

The object of this chapter is to acquaint the reader with a 
general working knowledge of the subject. Few laboratories 
are equipped with facilities for handling molten metals, so 
that the experimenter will often be obliged to have casts 
made by commercial foundries; but they are usually 
equipped for him to make his own patterns from which the 
casts are made. He will find it economical to do so, for the 
cost of having the patterns made may be many times the 
cost of the casts. In order to construct his patterns with 
intelligence, he should have an understanding of current 
foundry practice. 

The lost-wax method. The methods of casting metals 
fall into two classes: one, the "cire perdue," or "lost wax," 
and the other, "sand casting." The lost-wax method con- 
sists in burying a wax model, or pattern, in sand and fire 
clay, and then burning the wax out, leaving the mold ready 
to receive the metal. This method is employed in sculpture, 
and in dentistry for the casting of gold teeth, inlays, and so

forth, when only one cast is wanted, for obviously there can 
be only one cast made from a single pattern. Hence the 
name "lost wax." The method is useful for making small 
irregular objects. It is particularly good for casting small 
parts in gold, silver, or platinum, for ordinarily the experi- 
menter is loath to work such objects from solid metal. He 
finds it a nuisance to save the chips and filings that are too 
valuable to lose. 

The advantage of the lost-wax method is that the pattern 
may be of any imaginable complexity. Undercutting or the 
lack of it is of no importance. The only problem is in the 
arrangement of gates and risers for admitting the metal and 
for allowing the air to escape. In the case of hollow sculp- 
ture the core is usually supported in the mold by rods of the 
same metal as that of which the statue is to be cast. 

The wax used is a mixture of beeswax and paraffin. This 
mixture can be procured already prepared at a dental-supply 
house, or it can be made up readily, for the proportions are 
not critical. The wax is first softened by being heated until 
it is pliable; it is then roughly formed with the hands; and 
after that it is carved into the desired shape (Fig. 1). The 
carving may be done with any sharp instrument. If the opera- 
tor cuts away too much, he may replace it by picking up a 
piece of wax with a pair of tweezers, softening the wax in the 
flame, and then touching the tweezers to the spot that is to 
be filled in. The tweezers act much as a ruling pen. Fig. 1 
shows the making of a mandrel for winding the spiral tung- 
sten coils used in evaporating metals. This object is taken 
as an example because the double spiral thread that is 
required is very difficult to cut on a lathe. As will be seen 
from the illustration, it can easily be modeled in wax. 

Small models are held on the tip of a small rod. To 
remove the model from the rod, a piece of hot metal is held 
against the rod until it becomes warm enough for the wax 
at the tip to melt and allow the model to drop off. A hot- 
wire tool, such as is described in the chapter on quartz-fiber 
technique, would be a useful one for this purpose. When

the model is finished, it is stuck on the end of a tapered metal 
pin, which serves to support the model while the mold is 
being made, and which, when removed, leaves a channel, or 
sprue, through which the metal can flow. The object 
illustrated in Fig. 1 is shown as being modeled directly on

the tapered rod that also serves to form the sprue. Since 
the wax alone would hardly be strong enough to stand the 
winding of the wires that form the threads, the pin is 
shown as extending to the tip of the model — a procedure 
peculiar, of course, to the example illustrated. 

If the object is to be cast in lead, type metal, babbitt, tin, 
pewter, solder, or other such metals, the mold may be made 
of plaster of Paris. If it is to be of gold, silver, copper, 
brass, or other metals having a higher melting point, the

water and sets in about a minute. It should be mixed in the 
same way as plaster of Paris (Fig. 2) : A bowl is partly filled 
with water, and the investment is sprinkled into the water 
with the fingers until the level of the investment, which 
spreads out under the water, reaches the level of the water. 

Do not stir until all the in- 
vestment has been added. If 
there is a little pile standing 
above the water in the center of 
the bowl, wait until it is wet, 
and then stir gently to free 
any trapped bubbles. (Before 
starting the mold, oil the pin 
lightly to prevent the invest- 
ment from sticking to it.) With 
a soft brush, paint the outside of 
the model with the investment 
and water mixture (Fig. 3).

pour in the rest of the investment. Continue to hold the 
object until the investment is set (Fig. 4). The mold 
container should be an iron 
sleeve. A section of pipe 
faced off on the bottom in 
the lathe will do. Dentists 
use a ring which tapers 5° 
to 10°, the small end being 
the bottom. The taper 
serves to prevent the entire 
mold from being forced out 
of the ring and destroyed 
while the metal is being 
forced in. This point will ap- 
pear obvious in a later para- 
graph, which describes the 
process of pouring the metal. 
As soon as the investment 
has set, pull out the support- 
ing rod, and around the hole, or sprue, carve a small funnel 
to receive the metal (Fig. 5). Be careful to remove any bits 
of material that fall down the sprue. Place the whole thing 
in a ring stand and heat with a Bunsen burner. Heat until 
the whole mold is red hot, to make sure that the last traces of 
wax and moisture are driven off (Fig. 6).

The mold is now completed and ready to receive the metal. 
There remains the problem of getting the metal to flow into 
the mold. When the sprues are tiny and the masses of metal 
small, the surface tension may prevent the metal from flow- 
ing. Also, the trapped air in the mold will be a real obstacle. 
Dentists use a vacuum method for getting the air out of the 
mold. A metal disk with a hole in the center communicates 
with a small tank by means of a pipe. The pipe has a stop- 
cock, which is kept closed until the metal is melted. A

small hand pump is attached to the tank for reducing the air 
pressure to about one-half to one-fourth atmospheric pres- 
sure. The mold is placed on the disk, and the metal is melted 
in the funnel on the top of the mold with a blast lamp. 
When the metal is completely molten, the cock is opened, 
and the air in the mold is drawn out through its porosity, 
allowing the metal to flow in. Of course, air leaks around 
the cast, but that does not matter, since the object is to 
reduce the air pressure in the mold for only a few seconds. 
This method will make the finest of casts. 

Fig. 7 shows a setup of the type described above, which

can easily be assembled with the aid of a bicycle pump and 
a few accessories. 

Another method is to force the metal into the mold with 
steam. The metal is melted in the top of the mold as before. 
When it has melted, a large piece of moist clay is quickly 
pressed down onto the mold. The steam generated will 
force the metal into the mold. When this method is used, 
the mold should be placed on a perforated plate to allow the 
air to escape at the bottom (Fig. 8) .

Still another method introduces the metal into the mold 
by means of a centrifuge, which need be only a simple device 
consisting of a bar pivoted to rotate in a horizontal plane. 
A spring is arranged to rotate the arm, and a movable 
trigger acts as a stop to prevent the rotation until the metal 
is molten. The mold is placed in a holder at the end of the 
arm with its sprue facing the pivot. The crucible, a small 
trough of firebrick or any other suitable material, is mounted 
on the arm with the end of the trough adjacent to the sprue. 
The procedure is to cock the spring, place the mold in the 
holder, place the metal in the trough, and heat it with a hand 
torch. When the metal is ready, the trigger is pulled, and 
the whole arm spins on the pivot, the centrifugal force carry- 
ing the metal into the mold. For this method the bottom 



600 



MOLDING AND CASTING 



[Chap. XV 



of the mold should be made especially strong; otherwise it 
may give way and the molten metal be thrown about the 
room. This method is used by commercial jewelers as well 
as by some dentists. Fig. 9 shows a centrifuge of the type 
described. For casting the object illustrated in Fig. 1 this 
method should probably be used, since the top of the mold 
would hardly be large enough to contain the required amount 
of metal. 

In any of the foregoing methods metals such as gold, silver, 
copper, brass, and so forth, should be liberally sprinkled 
with borax as they are fused. This treatment prevents

oxides from forming. Metals such as lead, babbitt, solder, 
and so forth, may be kept covered with powdered charcoal 
for the same purpose. 

Patterns for sand casting. Sand casting from permanent 
patterns of metal or wood is the method commonly employed 
for all manner of mechanical parts, irrespective of size or of 
metal. Die casting is the only other method of importance, 
but it is restricted to commercial work in which the other- 
wise prohibitive cost of the metal dies is absorbed in the 
tremendous quantity of casts to be produced. In making 
the patterns for sand casting, the first step is to make a 
careful drawing of the object (Fig. 10). Over this drawing a 
second one should be made (Fig. 11), which is the pattern 
drawing. It can be made on thin paper. For future

convenience it is well to dimension the pattern drawing 
copiously. 

As an object for the illustrations that demonstrate sand 
casting, a polar axis for a telescope has been chosen. The 
axis is designed to have babbitt bearings. Such a design 
eliminates the necessity for chucking the whole axis in a 
lathe and boring it — a job to be accomplished only in a very 
large lathe. Figs. 10 and 12 show drawings of the parts

required, and Fig. 24 shows 
the completed mounting. 

In planning the pattern, the 
first thing that must be deter- 
mined is the plane of division 
of the mold. This plane 
should pass through the object 
in such a way that both parts 
of the pattern can be drawn 
from the sand mold. The plane 
must intersect the object in 
such a way that all points on 
the object, when they are pro- 
jected normally to the plane, 
will fall on or within the in- 
tersection. It is to this plane 
that all questions of "draft" 
are referred. If there is no single plane that will fulfill the 
requirements, one must be chosen which will come the near- 
est possible, and the parts that do not conform will have to 
be accomplished with cores. 

The pattern will be divided along the plane of division 
unless the plane happens to coincide with one surface of the 
object, in which case the pattern will be in one piece (Fig. 12). 
Since the usual cases are those in which the pattern must be 
divided into two halves, we will describe the procedure for a 
two-piece pattern. The designer need not be limited to the 
two-piece pattern, but the multi-piece pattern is so seldom 
employed that it is not within the scope of this chapter to

be used again.

treat of it. The reader is referred to books on commercial 
founding. 

Since parallel-sided objects can not be withdrawn from 
sand without the friction of the sides destroying the walls, it 
is necessary to taper the sides slightly. This taper is called 
"draft," and it may be as little as |° for fine commercial 
work. In most work, however, 3° is regarded as the proper 
draft angle. Round objects need no draft when the plane 
of separation passes through the axis. When the require- 
ments of the object are such that there can be no draft on 
one of the faces, that is, when that face must be at a right 
angle with the plane of separation, then the draft on all 
opposite faces should be doubled (Fig. 11). 

If there is a projection on one of the pieces of the pattern 
that does not touch the dividing plane, then between it and 
the dividing plane must be provided a separate block which 
can be removed after that half of the mold is made. This 
block is called the "false core," and the volume which it 
occupies in that half of the mold will be replaced by an equal 
volume of sand in the other half of the mold. The false core 
must also have draft. It will be seen later in the description 
of the process for making a mold that false cores must be 
used on only one piece of the mold, and that this must be 
the piece which has the holes to receive the pegs that hold 
the parts of the pattern in alignment. Since this is the part 
that is molded first, it must be capable of lying flat, with the 
plane of separation in contact with a table. If false cores 
are required on the other piece of the mold, they must be 
regarded as true cores. The blocks must be fixed in place 
and a core box made for them as will be described later in 
this chapter. 

If there is to be a hole through the object, bosses must be 
put on the pattern wherever the hole comes through the sur- 
face of the object. These bosses are to form sockets in the 
mold for carrying the ends of the core, thereby preventing 
its floating in the molten metal. The bosses must have 
draft angles to conform to the rest of the pattern. Separate 



604 



MOLDING AND CASTING 



[Chap. XV 



drawings should be made of the cores, the drawings to include 
the bosses just mentioned (Fig. 18). 

A core is any piece of sand or mold material that is molded 
separately and inserted in a mold, thereby forming a hole or 
cavity in the finished cast. If the core comes to the surface 
of the pattern at only one place, the boss to receive it must 
be long enough to support the core as a cantilever. Should 
this prove impractical, projections may be made on the core 
which will bear against the inside of the mold and carry the 
core. These projections will leave holes in the finished cast 
which will have to be plugged. Still another way is to use 
metal supports to carry the core. The supports are in the 
form of pins with broad heads and crooked shanks, and they 
are pressed into the sand by the molder. They weld with 
the metal of the cast. It is well to remember that not only 
must the core be supported against gravity in the empty 
mold, but it must also be restrained from floating in the 
molten metal when the mold is filled. 

Since nearly all metals shrink in solidifying, patterns have 
to be made enough larger to compensate. The amount of 
shrinkage varies with the metal. A list of shrinkage scales 
is given in Table I.

This shrinkage is the amount that must be added per foot 
to a pattern. For convenience, shrink rules may be pur- 
chased that are the correct amount oversize but are cali- 
brated as ordinary rules. 

For patterns that are to be cast many times, it is usual to 
reproduce the original wooden pattern in aluminum or some 
other metal, and to use this metal pattern for making the 
molds. In such case the original wooden pattern must be 
made large enough to allow for shrinkage of both metals. 
The allowance should be the sum of the shrinkages of both 
metals. Metal patterns are better for repeated use, since 
commercial foundries are quite rough on the wooden ones. 
Furthermore, several metal patterns may be reproduced 
from the first wooden one, and from these many molds may 
be made at a time. Thereby the cost of production is 
reduced. 

The rate of solidification of metal in the mold is a function 
of the thickness of the metal. Since the greater part of the 
shrinkage occurs at the instant of solidification, it is apparent 
that unequal thicknesses of metal in the same pattern will 
cause a certain amount of distortion and warping. For this 
reason patterns are usually designed to have as uniform a 
thickness throughout as possible. Of course, the warping 
may be unimportant, since small projecting lugs on large 
casts will be carried by large masses of metal. Neverthe- 
less, care should be exercised in designing the patterns to 
preserve the equality of thickness. Metals cooling from 
the molten state do not necessarily shrink evenly as the 
temperature falls. White cast iron, for instance, shrinks a 
while, then expands a little, and then continues shrinking. 
Gray iron expands twice and phosphorous iron three times. 
Thus, in casts of uneven thickness one part may be shrinking 
while another is expanding, with the result that the casts 
will be under stresses. In fact, the casts may be broken by 
the stresses. The hand wheels that are used to tighten the 
brakes on freight cars are made with spiral spokes, because 
the uneven cooling of the thick hub and the thin rim sets up 



606 



MOLDING AND CASTING 



[Chap. XV 



stresses in the spokes which might break them if they were 
straight. 

Pure metal, such as aluminum, copper, tin, or zinc, may- 
be cast in almost any thickness. The case is different with 
the alloys, especially with those alloys in which there is a 
great difference between the melting points of the constitu- 
ent metals. The alloys cooled slowly have time to grow 
large crystals. In fact, some of the constituent metals may 
crystallize out, so that thick alloy castings may be weak and 
full of crystal pockets. The best thickness for alloy castings

seems to be between T 3 U and ^ inch. Even f inch is not 
too thin. All metals, pure or alloyed, must be cast in a 
thickness sufficient for the metal to reach all parts of the 
mold before it sets. However, this matter is not too impor- 
tant, for a good molder can arrange his gates to insure that 
the molten metal reaches all parts of the mold before it 
solidifies. 

Patterns are usually made of wood — white pine, sugar 
pine, or mahogany. The wood should be clear and well 
seasoned. If the pattern is in two pieces (not including false 
cores), they must be pinned together in such a way that they

can be separated and reassembled by the molder. In mak- 
ing the pattern, it is well first to make the division part with 
its pins. Wooden dowels may be used, or special pins and 
sockets, which can be purchased from a hardware dealer 
(Figs. 13 and 14).

practice in carpentry and cabinetmaking. The parts may

be glued together at will, and all the tricks of joinery may be 
employed, provided the finished result is the desired shape. 
The exterior surfaces of the pattern should be carefully 
smoothed. Any roughnesses or irregularities in the sur- 
faces, particularly in the draft surfaces, will mean that the 
molder will have to rap the pattern vigorously to free it from 
the mold, with the result that the mold, and consequently 
the cast, will be larger than designed.

Each piece of pattern, including the false cores, should be 
provided with a rapping plate, which is set in flush with the 
parting face (Fig. 15). These plates can be purchased from 
a hardware dealer. They provide a hole for rapping and a 
hole for a lifting screw, or handle, which the molder will use in 
withdrawing the pattern from the sand. 

In making casts it has been found that sharp, inter- 
nal corners and dihedral angles are a source of trouble. 
The sharp edges of the mold may crumble, or strains in the 
metal may cause the cast to break at these corners. To 
avoid such trouble, it is the practice to round the corners,

and the corners so rounded are called "fillets." They may 
be carved in the pattern, but it is easier to make them of 
wax. The wax can be purchased at hardware stores. It 
comes on spools or in strips in the form of an extruded ribbon 
of the proper profile. Before the ribbon is used, the pattern 
must be shellacked. The ribbon, cut into convenient 
lengths, is rubbed into place with a hot tool that has a ball- 
shaped end (Fig. 16). The fillets are sold in sizes according 
to the radius desired, and the tools can be made or purchased 
to correspond. After the fillets are finished, the whole 
pattern is again shellacked. In patterns that are to be used 
only once the fillets may be made of plastiline or plasticine,

which can be purchased at an artists' supply house. Only 
the hardest grade should be used. It will stick quite well to 
the shellacked pattern, and may be modeled with the fingers 
or with wooden modeling 
tools. It should be shel- 
lacked when it is finished. 
For larger work, leather fil- 
lets can be purchased in many 
sizes. They are glued 
directly to the wooden pat- 
tern, finished with sandpa- 
per, and shellacked. 

If there are no cores, clear 
shellac is used over the whole 
pattern; but if there are 
cores, the projections which correspond to the ends of the 
cores are left in the clear shellac finish or are painted red, 
while the rest of the pattern is finished with shellac and lamp- 
black. The shellac and lampblack are usually mixed to give 
a dead black finish. The mixture is liberally thinned with 
alcohol. The reason for this color distinction is that it tells 
the molder where the cores belong (Fig. 17). 

If the pattern has cores, the 
next problem is to make the 
core boxes. These are essen- 
tially wooden molds, in which 
the cores are cast. The re- 
quirements for draft and shrink- 
age are the same as for the pat- 
terns. If the core requires a 
two-piece mold, as for cylin- 
drical shapes and the like, the 
plane of division need have no 
relation to the plane of divi- 
sion of the original pattern. There is no need to pin the two 
sides of the core box together, for the two halves of the core 
are made separately and are stuck together after they are

baked. When the two halves are alike, it is necessary to 
make a box for only one side. If simple cylindrical cores are 
required, it is unnecessary to make the boxes at all, for most 

foundries have stock boxes, 
or even stock cores. In 
general, core boxes are carved 
from solid wood, and they 
are frequently more complex 
than the pattern itself (Fig. 
19). 

The core in the illustration 
is shown to be made in two 
pieces, because the surface in 
the mold which it has to fit has draft. If the pattern had no 
draft on this top face, the core could easily be in one piece. 
Core boxes are made of sugar pine or any other clear and 
workable wood, and they are finished with shellac like the 
patterns. One point is important : Since the pattern shows 
only the ends of the core, and since the core may be un- 
symmetrical longitudinally, it is well to make the ends 
different, so that the molder will get the core in the proper 
orientation. 

The process of making cylindrical core boxes, as it has 
been practiced for years, is very interesting. A core-box 
plane is used, the face of 
which is two surfaces at 90° 
to each other. The plane 
iron comes through the edge 
of these surfaces and is 
sharpened to conform to 
them. Two parallel lines 
are drawn on the surface of 
the stock that is to be used. 
The plane is made to cut away all the wood possible without 
removing the two lines. The 90° angle automatically gener- 
ates a semicircular groove (Fig. 20). The plane can be used 
to generate conical shapes as well.

Sand casting. The procedure for making the mold is as 
follows : The molder first separates the pattern and sets the 
part that has no pegs with its separation plane face down on 
the table, putting the false cores in place. Around this 
piece he puts a wooden or metal frame called a "drag." The 
"drag" and the "cope" together constitute the "flask," 
which is a framework to contain the sand forming the mold. 
The cope and the drag are open rectangular boxes without 
lid or bottom. They are fitted with crossbars to help hold 
the sand. There are three sockets in the rim of the drag and 
three corresponding pins in the rim of the cope which permit 
them to be separated and reassembled in the same relation 
as shown in Fig. 21(a). 

The molder next sprinkles molding sand through a riddle, 
or sieve, until the drag is half full. Molding sand is a mix- 
ture of fine clear sand and a small amount of clay, and some- 
times a little powdered charcoal or graphite. It has been 
moistened until a handful compressed will retain the print of 
the hand and will form a fairly firm piece, but moistened 
not so much but that it can be shaken through a riddle of 
about j-inch mesh, the riddle being shaken vigorously. 
Molding sand is used over and over again with only the 
addition necessary to replace the inevitable losses. 

When the drag has been half filled, the sand is carefully 
tamped around the pattern. A wooden implement is used

which is about the shape and size of a dumbbell except that 
one end is flat and the other is a blunt, truncated wedge as 
shown in Fig. 21(b). More sand is added and tamped until 
the drag is level, full, and firmly tamped. The sand is then 
perforated with a thin metal wire to assist the escape of

picked up bodily and inverted on the table, exposing the 
separation face of the pattern. The false cores are removed 
as shown in Figs. 21(d) and 21(e).

Dry sand is sprinkled over all the exposed sand of the mold 
as illustrated in Fig. 21(f) to prevent the two halves of the 
mold from sticking together. The cope is placed on the 
drag. It is filled with sand and is tamped, as was the drag, 
as shown in Fig. 21(g). The sand is pierced many times 
with a thin wire, as in the case of the drag, in the manner 
illustrated in Fig. 21(h). 

At a point in the sand well clear of the pattern, a sprue is 
cut deep enough to reach a little below the separation plane. 
It is cut with a piece of thin-walled brass tubing which is 
pressed gently into the sand and removed, bringing with it a 
plug of sand as shown in Fig. 21 (i). The hole left is about 
an inch in diameter, large enough for casts of 10 to 100 pounds. 
It is well to cut the hole an inch at a time. It is not cut to 
communicate directly with the pattern, for the force of the 
descending metal might injure the mold. A trough is cut 
around the top of the hole as illustrated in Figs. 21 (j) and 
21(k), and into this the metal will be poured. 

The cope is now carefully lifted off the drag and laid be- 
side it, face up. A rod is inserted in the rapping plate and 
rapped smartly in all directions to break the adhesion of the 
sand as shown in Fig. 21(1). A handle is screwed into the 
rapping plate, and the pattern is carefully withdrawn from 
the sand as illustrated in Fig. 21(m). 

A channel, or "gate," is next cut along the parting plane 
from the mold to the sprue. The reason for not cutting the 
sprue to communicate directly with the mold is that the 
sudden rush of heavy metal directly into the mold might 
injure it. The horizontal gate breaks the fall of the metal as 
shown in Figs. 21(m) and 21(n). 

The mold should be closely inspected for broken corners 
and edges that must be carefully mended and modeled with 
steel molder's tools. Bits of sand that have fallen in are 
brushed away with a soft brush or are blown out with a 
bellows. A cloth bag half full of powdered graphite is 
shaken over the mold, and frequently powdered graphite is 
painted on the surface of the mold with a soft camel's-hair

brush as shown in Fig. 21(o). In iron and steel castings this 
coating of graphite is responsible for the very hard surface 
layer. Its function is to harden the surface of the mold, 
and also partly to fill the grainy surface of the sand. 

The pattern is removed from the cope as illustrated in 
Fig. 21 (p) in the same manner as from the drag. If the cast 
is complicated or very large, a riser or several risers are cut 
in the cope. They are like the sprue, except that they are 
cut from the highest parts of the mold. In complicated 
molds they assist in carrying off the entrapped air; in large 
molds they serve to collect the slag that rises to the surface, 
and to provide reservoirs for extra metal that will flow back 
into the mold as the metal within cools and shrinks. This 
is shown in Fig. 21 (q). 

The mold is now ready to receive the cores and to be put 
together. For thin casts in alloy the halves of the mold may 
be heated with a blowtorch to drive off the water nearest the 
surface, which otherwise would cool the metal before it had 
time to flow. 

Cores are made by filling the core boxes with a mixture of 
coarse sand and a binder. The core boxes are tamped full 
and leveled off with a straightedge. They are then inverted

on sheets of metal, rapped, and removed, leaving the halves 
of the core, which are baked for a few hours in an oven. The 
baked halves are stuck together with the mixture of which 
they are made, or with mucilage or paste, and are baked

again (Fig. 22). Pure silica sand which has passed through 
a 50-mesh screen and has been retained on a 70-mesh screen 
should be used. Many substances may be used as binders, 
a complete list of which the reader will find in books on 
founding. The ones most easily available are given in 
Table II, together with the amounts to be used.

The halves of the core

mold. 



Fig. 22. Sand casting. Making the cores. 



If linseed oil is used, the cores must be baked at 425°F. for 
1| hours. For the others 350°F. for 1^ hours will do. Lin- 
seed oil makes the strongest cores, and pitch and resin the 
weakest. 

When the cores are thin and fragile, they are frequently 
reinforced with iron wires. If the cores are very bulky, 
provision should be made for conducting away the gases that 
will be formed in them and that will blow the cast apart if 



Chap. XV] MOLDING AND CASTING 619 

allowed to remain unvented. Such provision is made by- 
laying strips of wax in the sand as the cores are being made. 
When the cores are baked, the wax is driven off, leaving 
holes for the gases to escape through. 

The completed cores are placed in the molds, and the 
flask is reassembled. The halves — the cope and drag — 
should be securely clamped together, for otherwise the metal 
may actually float the cope off and let out the metal as shown 
in Fig. 21 (t). The mold is now ready to be filled as illus- 
trated in Figs. 21 (r) and 21 (s). 

For production work, when numbers of identical casts are 
required, match boards are used. These are boards having 
pins and sockets that correspond to those in the cope and 
drag, one to fit the cope and one to fit the drag. The two 
halves of the pattern are permanently fixed to the boards, 
properly placed to insure correct matching of the two. The 
halves of the mold are then made separately. They may 
even be made by separate workmen, and are not assembled 
until the time for the pouring. In the case of metal patterns 
several are placed on each board so that a number may be 
cast at a time. 

The molten metal should be poured gently into the mold. 
It is well to skim back the slag and scum that form on the 
top of the metal in the crucible or ladle. For the soft metals, 
which can be handled in iron containers, a kettle having a 
spout that communicates with the bottom may be used. 
The floating slag and oxides will be left in the kettle. In 
molds involving large masses of metal it is common for the 
workmen to stir the metal in the mold. They churn it up 
and down in the riser with an iron rod. This action prevents 
the metal in the riser from solidifying until the outer shell 
of the cast has set. As the center of the cast sets, the metal 
in the riser descends and prevents shrinkage pockets from 
being left in the top of the cast. The escaping gases usually 
burn briskly, but if they burn too much at the division of the 
mold, the flames should be doused with water to save the flask 
from being badly charred. 



620 



MOLDING AND CASTING 



[Chap. XV 



Large casts are usually left overnight to cool. Smaller 
ones may be immediately dug out of the mold. In fact, it is 
the practice in a certain instrument company to remove the 
small casts immediately from the sand and throw them red 
hot into the water. The steam generated blows away the 
sand and even blows out the cores, leaving the casts virtually 
clean. 

When the sprues and gates and risers have been cut off, 
the cast is ready to be machined or otherwise finished as 
shown in Fig. 21 (u). 

In having the casts made it is often desirable to estimate 

the weight of the finished casts before they are ordered. 

Such an estimation is easily made : Weigh the pattern, allow 

for the cores, and multiply the result by a coefficient which is 

the ratio of the weight of the pattern material to the weight 

of the metal of the cast. A short list of these coefficients is 

given in Table III.

are commercially available having different properties, some 
being suitable for high-speed bearings and others for bearings 
which must work under heavy loads. Bearings of babbitt 
are usually cast in some sort of carrier, so that the babbitt 
forms a bushing. These bearings are sometimes cast as

frequently they are cast in two halves with a dummy shaft 
in place. For many purposes such bearings are good enough 
just as they are, but for precision bearings they should be 
scraped to fit the spindle. A dummy shaft should always 
be used, because the hot babbitt metal is apt to warp the 
shaft. Fig. 23 shows the method of casting a split bearing.

Cuttlebone casting. There remains one other method of 
casting which might be found useful in the laboratory. This 
is cuttlebone casting. The desirable properties of the 
method are the ease and rapidity with which a cast can be 
produced: A mold can easily be made and filled in half an 
hour. The objects to be cast should not exceed the dimen- 
sions of j inch in thickness, 1| inches in width, and 3 inches in 
length. The patterns should be of metal, since they must be 
subjected to pressure. Draft angles can be very slight, or 
they may be ignored altogether. There can be no cores. 
Fig. 25 shows the method quite clearly. Cuttlebones can be 
procured from a pet shop or drug store for a few cents. The 
soft, calcareous face is easily crushed and takes a very firm 
imprint of any object that is pressed into it. Difficulty of 
pressing thick patterns into the cuttlebone can be overcome
