<title>Procedures in Experimental Physics - John Strong</title>
<body>
<h2>Preface</h2>

It is the purpose of this book to describe important procedures in experimental physics. Subjects of special interest and value to the authors in their own investigations have been selected for treatment. Many of the procedures and results of research appear here in print for the first time. 

The ideal way to learn the procedures of experimental physics is by direct contact with them in the laboratory. Realizing this, we have endeavored to bridge the gap between laboratory demonstrations and experience on the one hand, and exposition on the other, by the liberal use of figures. 

I am indebted to Mr. D. O. Hendrix for most of the procedures presented in Chapter II, and to Dr. R. M. Langer for the treatment of the unsteady flow of heat presented in Chapter XII.

I have drawn freely from many books and scientific periodicals. It is hoped that there are no lapses in my effort to acknowledge adequately the source of this material. 

The assistance of my wife, of Mrs. Elizabeth H. Hayward, and of Mr. James T. Barkelew in the preparation of the manuscript is gratefully acknowledged, as is also the helpfulness and courtesy of the Prentice-Hall editors.
