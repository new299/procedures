<h3>Introduction.</h3>
<p>Some of the equations from the kinetic theory are important in the design, construction, and operation of vacuum apparatus. Accordingly, we will begin our treatment of the technique of high vacuum with a discussion of them. The derivations of these equations are omitted, since we are interested only in their applications.</p>

<p>The laws of ideal gases. The laws of ideal gases are 
represented, mathematically, by Eqs. 1 and 2.</p>

<img width=25% style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" align="bottom" src="eq1_2.png">

<p>P<sub>1</sub> represents the total pressure exerted on the walls of a vessel containing wi grams of a gas of molecular weight M<sub>1</sub>, when this vessel has a volume V and is maintained at an absolute temperature T. If more than one gas is present, for example, if the vessel contains w<sub>1</sub> grams of one gas of molecular weight M<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>1</sub> grams of a second gas of molecular weight M<sub>1</sub>, and so forth, the partial pressure exerted by each gas is given by Eq. 1.</p>

<p>The total pressure, given by Eq. 2, is the sum of these partial pressures. The value of the constant R, the so-called universal gas constant, is independent of the molecular weight of the gas, but its value does depend on the units in which the pressure and volume are expressed. In vacuum work the pressure is usually expressed in millimeters of mercury<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2">[2]</a></sup> and the volume in cubic centimeters, in which case R has the value of 62,370.</p>

<p>Eqs. 1 and 2 are based on the assumptions, first, that the molecules are infinitely small and, second, that no intermolecular forces exist. Neither assumption is valid for real gases. Nevertheless, the equations describe the behavior of real gases, especially hydrogen and helium, with sufficient accuracy for our purposes here. Although the equations break down at elevated pressures (pressures greater than 1 atmosphere), they become increasingly precise if the pressure is reduced. And, at pressures encountered in vacuum work, Eqs. 1 and 2 not only apply to the description of the behavior of gases but describe the behavior of many unsaturated vapors as well.</p>

<h3>The mean free path.</h3>

<p>The mean free path is the average distance traversed by molecules between successive intermolecular collisions. The magnitude of this quantity is determined by the size of the molecules and is given by the formula:

<img width=25% style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" align="bottom" src="eq3.png">

&sigma; represents the molecular diameters and n the number of molecules per cubic centimeter. Values of the mean free path for nitrogen calculated by Eq. 3, using 3.1 X 10 -8 cm 
for the molecular diameters, are given in Table I. 

<img width=25% style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" align="bottom" src="table1.png">

<h3>Viscosity and heat conductivity.</h3>

<p>The viscosity and heat conductivity of a gas, like the mean free path, depend on the molecular diameters. As a result, we have the relationship 
between the mean free path and the viscosity &eta;, </p>

<img width=25% style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" align="bottom" src="eq4.png">

<p>and the relationship between the viscosity and the thermal 
conductivity K, 

<img width=25% style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;" align="bottom" src="eq5.png">

Substituting PM/RT for p and Eq. 3 for X in Eq. 4, we 
see that the pressure cancels. In other words, Eq. 4 pre- 
dicts that the viscosity will be the same at reduced pressure 
as it is at ordinary pressures. The experimental verification 
of this prediction by Meyer and Maxwell was a triumph for 
the kinetic theory. 3 They measured the damping of a 
torsion pendulum in a bell jar at pressures varying from 1 
atmosphere to about 10 mm of mercury. The damping 
produced by the viscosity of the air was found to be the 
same at all pressures. 

Eq. 5 predicts that the heat conductivity is also indepen- 
dent of the pressure. This was established experimentally 
by Stefan. 4 

Eqs. 4 and 5 are derived from the assumption that the 
mean free path is small in comparison with the size of the 
apparatus. Table I shows the pressures at which this 
assumption becomes invalid. 

If Meyer and Maxwell had reduced the pressure in their 
bell jar below about 10 _1 mm, they would have observed a 
decrease in the damping effect on the torsion pendulum.

Chap. Ill] TECHNIQUE OF HIGH VACUUM 97 

Likewise, if Stefan had extended his observations, he would 
have found a decrease in the heat conductivity towards 
10 _1 mm and its complete disappearance below about 
10~ 4 mm. 

Pumping speeds. Consider that a vessel contains a gas 
at pressure P and opens through an aperture to a region 
where a high vacuum is maintained. Further assume that 
this high vacuum is to be maintained at a pressure so much 
lower than P that it is essentially a perfect vacuum. The 
volume of gas escaping through the aperture per unit time, 
dV/dt, measured at pressure P, is given by the formula 

^ = AJl.32 X 10 7 Jj cm 3 /sec, (7) 

where A is the area of the aperture. The value of dV/dt for 
air (M = 29) at room temperature {T = 300° Kelvin) is 
11,700 cc/sec. cm 2 , or 11.7 liters/sec. cm 2 . It is a note- 
worthy feature of this formula that dV/dt is independent of 
the pressure in the vessel. 

A hypothetical aperture of unit area communicating with 
an essentially perfect vacuum may be regarded as a pump 
with a speed of 11.7 liters/sec. Oil and mercury diffusion 
pumps have two characteristics in common with such an 
aperture. They have pumping speeds of the same order of 
magnitude as the aperture, and their observed pumping 
speeds are roughly constant over a considerable pressure 
range. 

The speed of a diffusion pump is, accordingly, expressed as 
the volume of gas passing through the throat of the pump 
measured at the pressure which obtains at the throat. The 
speed factor of a pump is the ratio of its speed per unit area 
of the throat to the value 11.7 liters /sec. A good oil 
diffusion pump has a speed factor of about 0.5 or 0.6. The 
speed factor for mercury diffusion pumps 5 varies from 0.1 
to 0.3.

The pumping speed of diffusion pumps can be measured 
by means of a leak like the one shown in Fig. 1. Gas at 
atmospheric pressure is allowed to leak into the pumping 
line. The rate at which the gas is introduced is measured 

by the motion of a mercury 
pellet in the calibrated capillary 
tube. At the same time the 
pressure at the throat of the 
pump is determined with a 
vacuum manometer. The rate 
dV/dt at which gas passes 
through the pump is obtained 
by multiplying the volume 
which the mercury pellet sweeps 
through per unit time by the 
ratio of the pressure in the cap- 
illary (that is, the barometric 
pressure) to the pressure which 
obtains at the pump throat. 

Conductance of vacuum 
pumping lines. Ordinarily, a 
pump is connected to an ap- 
paratus by a tube or system of 
tubes which constitute the vac- 
uum pumping line. The meas- 
ured speed of the pump, which 
we will designate S , at one 
end of the vacuum line is greater than the effective pump- 
ing speed, S, at the other end of the line. Naturally, the 
difference between S and S is small if the pumping tubes 
are short and have a large diameter. The difference be- 
tween *S -1 and /So -1 determines the capacity of a vacuum line. 
The capacity is the reciprocal of W, the resistance of the 
vacuum line to the flow of gas. The relationship of the 
quantities So, S, and W is given by the formula

Chap. Ill] TECHNIQUE OF HIGH VACUUM 99 

W, in turn, is defined in terms of tube dimensions by Knud- 
sen's formula, 

where I is the length of the pumping line and d is its diameter, 
both expressed in centimeters. 6 The first term in the par- 
entheses represents the resistances of the line, while the 
second term represents the resistance of the two ends of the 
line (or the resistance of a sharp bend in the line). The 
second term is usually insignificant in comparison with the 
first and may be neglected. For example, W. Klose found 
that a straight pumping channel with four right-angle 
bends, one with four T-shaped enlargements, and a curved 
tube of equal diameter all exhibited essentially the same 
pumping speed. 7 

The coefficient of Eq. 9 becomes unity if 29, the molecular 
weight of air, is substituted for M, room temperature of 
300° K. is substituted for T, and 8r 3 is substituted for d 3 , 
where r is the radius of the tube. It is further required that 
V and r be expressed in millimeters and that W be expressed 
in sec. /liter instead of sec/cm 3 . After making these sub- 
stitutions and neglecting the second term in the parentheses, 
Eq. 9 reduces to 

w> = K^Si. CIO) 

W r 3 liter K±V) 

An an example of the application of Eq. 10, consider a 
pumping tube of 250 mm length and 5 mm radius. This 
gives a value of W equal to 2 sec. /liter. Substituting this 
value in Eq. 8, we see that the pumping speed S can never 
exceed \ liter /sec, even if a very fast pump is used, for which 
1//S is practically zero. 

Evacuation. The factors determining the rate at which an 
apparatus is evacuated are the volume of the apparatus, V, 

6 Knudsen, M., Ann. d. Physik, 28, 75, 999 (1908). This formula applies 
when d is less than the mean free path.

100 TECHNIQUE OF HIGH VACUUM [Chap. Ill 

the effective speed of the system of pumps, S, and the 
limiting pressure which the pumps are capable of attaining, 
P . The method of evaluating the first factor, V, is obvious. 
The value of S may be calculated from the values of S and 
W by Eqs. 8 and 10, or it may be measured by connecting 
the leak and gauge to the apparatus. 

The value of P is not easy to estimate, so it is necessary 
to measure it with a gauge. P does not depend on the 
pumping speed of the pumps on tight systems which are 
outgassed. When the system is leaking or giving off gas, 
P depends on the rate of leaking as well as the speed of 
the pumps. On a tight outgassed system the limiting 
pressure for mercury diffusion pumps equipped with a liquid 
air trap is 10 -7 mm or less. For oil diffusion pumps without 
traps the limiting pressure varies from 10 -5 to 10~ 6 mm, 
although lower values are occasionally reported. The 
vacuum attainable with mechanical pumps is usually 10~ 2 
to 10 -4 mm. The water aspirator is restricted to work at 
pressures above the vapor pressure of water, about 25 mm 
of mercury at room temperature. 

The effect of outgassing on P is illustrated by an experi- 
ment described by Dushman. 8 He found a limiting pressure 
of 0.033 bar for a Gaede rotary pump connected to a vacuum 
gauge when the connecting glass tube was giving off gas. 
When the glass tubing, however, was baked out until its 
surface was free of absorbed moisture and other gases, the 
limiting pressure was reduced to 0.0007 bar. 

The rate at which the pressure is reduced in an apparatus, 
as determined by the pumping speed S, the volume V, and 
the limiting pressure P 0> is given by the equation 

S = - v (p ~ Po) - (11) 

The integration of this equation yields

Eq. 12 is useful, for example, in predicting the time 
(t 2 — h) required for a vacuum system to recover from a 
surge of gas which raises the pressure to the value Pi. In 
this case P 2 represents the working pressure required in the 
apparatus. 

If P 2 and Pi are much larger than P , then P may be 
neglected, and Eq. 12 can be simplified to the form

adequately described in the literature. 10 

Outgassing of glass and metals. Outgassing removes 
gases adsorbed to the surface of glass and metal. It is 
necessary to outgas exposed glass and metal in order to ob- 
tain the highest degree of vacuum. Prolonged heating of 
glass at 150° to 200°C. in vacuum removes most of the gases 
adsorbed on the surface, while further heating to 300°C. 
removes the final monomolecular film of water and ad- 
sorbed gases. Gases liberated when the heating is carried 
above this temperature originate from the decomposition 
of the glass. 11 

In practice, lead-glass apparatus is outgassed by heating 
it in an oven or with a soft flame to a maximum temperature 
of 360°C. for a time varying from 10 minutes to an hour or 
more. Lime glass and hard glass are heated to 400° and 
500°C. respectively. Higher temperatures are to be avoided, 
since the annealing or softening point of soft glass is only 
425°C. and of hard glass 550°C. 

Before a glass apparatus is sealed off from the pumps, the 
seal-off constriction is heated for a minute or two at a tem- 
perature just below the softening point of the glass. 

When metals are strongly heated in a vacuum, they give 
off adsorbed gases as well as absorbed gases and gas arising 
from the decomposition of oxides near the surface. Gases 
under the surface layer of the metal, both dissolved gases 
and those held in chemical combination, are difficult to re- 
move, even at elevated temperatures, unless the metal is 
fused. The metal oxides, with the exception of chromium 
oxide, are readily dissociated in vacuum at elevated tempera- 
tures. Metals which have been fused in vacuum are now 
available commercially. 12

Surface gas on tungsten wire is liberated by a temperature 
of 1500°C. From 70 to 80 per cent of this gas is carbon 
monoxide, and the remainder is hydrogen and carbon diox- 
ide. 13 The volume of surface gas evolved, measured at 
standard conditions, amounts to three or four times the 
volume of the tungsten wire. Sweetser studied. the gas 
liberated by copper, nickel, Monel, and copper-coated 
nickel-iron alloy (Dumet). He found that these metals 
rarely gave off a volume of gas greater than the volume of the 
wire. 14 

Marshall and Norton have studied the gases given off 
by tungsten, molybdenum, and graphite. 16 After these ma- 
terials have been outgassed by prolonged heating in vacuum 
at temperatures above 1800°C, they may be exposed to 
atmospheric pressure, and the gases which they then take up 
are readily removed by subsequent reheating to a moderate 
temperature in vacuum. However, they should not be 
touched with the fingers. 

Many metals may be heated in hydrogen to remove 
surface contamination. At the same time dissolved gases 
near the surface of the metal are, in part, replaced by the 
hydrogen. This substitution is desirable, since hydrogen 
comes off readily when the metal is subsequently heated 
in vacuum either in a bake-out oven or by high-frequency 
induction.

waxes used in vacuum work. The numbers given there

Getters. Ordinarily, in the laboratory, a diffusion pump 
is used to remove the residual gases which roughing pumps 
cannot remove, and the resulting high vacuum is maintained 
by continued pumping. There are, however, other methods 
of removing the residual gases in an apparatus which is 
sealed off at the pressure attainable with a roughing pump. 16 
These methods involve the use of so-called getters, which 
not only remove the residual gases initially, but maintain 
the vacuum against the deteriorating effects of subsequent 
outgassing. 

Getters may be grouped into three classes, depending on 
the manner in which they remove residual gases. Some 
depend on the physical adsorption of the residual gases on 
the refrigerated surface of a porous substance like charcoal 
or silica gel; others absorb the gas in the manner that hydro- 
gen is absorbed by palladium black or tantalum; and still 
others combine with the residual gas chemically.

Action of Getters in Sealed Tubes," Am. Chem. Soc, J., S3, 1674 (1931).

The high absorbing capacity of charcoal and silica gel is 
due in part to their large surfaces. The surface of charcoal, 
for example, is estimated to be as great as 2500 square 
meters per gram. Absorbent charcoal to be used for re- 
moving residual gas is itself first outgassed by heating it in 
the vacuum produced by the roughing pumps. It should 
not be heated above the softening temperature of Pyrex, be- 
cause it will lose some of its absorption capacity owing to 
"crystallization" of the charcoal and attendant loss of sur- 
face area. After this outgassing the pumps are turned off 
to isolate the vacuum system, and the charcoal is cooled 
(preferably with liquid air) to develop its absorbing capacity. 
The absorbing power of charcoal for various gases at 0°C. 
and — 185°C. (liquid air temperature) is given in Table IV.

Of the metal getters, tantalum is of special interest. It 
absorbs hydrogen in large volumes — it may absorb as much 
as 740 times its own volume of gas at temperatures around 
600°C. This absorbed gas is given off when the metal is 
heated in vacuum at temperatures greater than 800°C. At 
high temperatures, tantalum is one of the metals most easily 
outgassed. At elevated temperatures the residual gases, 
oxygen and nitrogen, are also removed by chemical combina- 



106 TECHNIQUE OF HIGH VACUUM [Chap. Ill 

tion with tantalum. Because of these properties, it is fre- 
quently used for radio-tube anodes. The metals columbium 
and zirconium behave in much the same way as tantalum. 

Tungsten and molybdenum, at temperatures above 
1000°C, are effective getters. 17 Oxygen is removed by these 
metals by the formation of oxides which are volatile at 
temperatures above 1000°C. Hydrogen is dissociated by the 
high temperature and condenses as atomic hydrogen on the 
container walls, especially if they are cooled with liquid air. 

The alkali metals react with nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, 
and mercury vapor. The absorption of nitrogen, oxygen, 
and hydrogen is especially strong when the alkali metal is 
the cathode of a glow discharge. 

Barium, calcium, and magnesium are extensively used as 
getters, since they combine chemically with all residual 
gases (noble gases excepted). Barium is more active chemi- 
cally than calcium. These metals are introduced by various 
ways into the vacuum tubes in which they are to serve as 
getters. Calcium may be introduced in the form of fresh 
filings. Barium may be introduced in the form of copper- 
or nickel-covered wire. Either metal may be formed directly 
in vacuum by reducing it at elevated temperatures from one 
of its compounds. Usually the introduced metal is vaporized 
and condensed on the walls of the sealed-off vacuum system, 
where it forms a mirror. The getter action of the metal is 
greater in the vapor phase, although the condensed mirror 
film, especially a film of barium, will react chemically with 
residual gases which may subsequently appear in the appa- 
ratus. 

A metal film exhibits, in addition to the chemical action, 
a physical action which may be of considerable significance. 
This physical action, the adsorption of gases, is strong be- 
cause the metal surface is clean. Dushman gives an ele- 
mentary calculation illustrating this action. 18 A spherical

bulb 5 cm in radius containing residual gas at a pressure of 
about to mm of mercury will be completely evacuated when 
sufficient gas is adsorbed on the inside surface of the bulb 
or on a clean metal film to form a monomolecular layer. 

Water and many vapors may be effectively removed by a 
trap cooled in liquid air. The density of water vapor in a 
gas, after it is passed through a liquid air trap, is 10 -23 
mg/liter. The relative effectiveness of some of the more 
commonly used drying agents is shown in Table V. 19 Of

these, phosphorus pentoxide is the one most frequently used 
in vacuum work. It should be fused to reduce its vapor 
pressure and to prevent it from flying about when the 
system is evacuated. 

Static and kinetic vacuum systems. Most of the vacuum 
systems used in physical research fall into two general classes. 
In the first class we have those systems which are required 
to be thoroughly outgassed and entirely free from leaks in 
order to obtain a high degree of vacuum. We will call 
systems of this type static vacuum systems, in contrast to

systems in which outgassing from glass on metal parts or in 
which even small leaks may be tolerated, owing to the use 
of extremely fast pumps. We will designate systems of the 
latter type as kinetic vacuum systems. 

Fig. 3 illustrates a typical static vacuum system. It 
represents an X-ray tube being evacuated with a mercury 
diffusion pump of moderate speed. Pressures as low as 
10 -9 mm (or even 10 -10 mm) are obtained in some static 
vacuum systems. Such extremely high vacuum is required 
for investigating the photoelectric effect, thermionic emis- 
sion, and other physical phenomena for which the slightest 
contamination of a surface is to be avoided. Static vacuum 
systems are not treated extensively here. The reader who 
is especially interested in them is referred to the literature. 

Kinetic vacuum systems are characterized by a limiting 
pressure of 10 -5 to 10 -6 mm obtained by the use of extremely 
fast pumps. These pumps, as well as the apparatus which 
they exhaust, are usually made in the machine shop from 
ordinary brass and steel. The metal is not outgassed as in 
static vacuum systems. 

Kinetic vacuum systems are inferior to static systems, 
where surface contamination must be scrupulously avoided. 
They are, however, satisfactory for applications where the 
function of the vacuum is to allow the unhindered motion of 
molecular rays, electrons, ions, and light quanta. For ex- 
ample, kinetic vacuum systems have been applied with 
success to the vacuum evaporation process for metalizing 
large telescope mirrors, to the maintenance of vacuum in 
high- voltage X-ray tubes, metal rectifier tubes, and oscillator 
tubes, and to the evacuation of spectrographs. 

Fig. 4 shows a kinetic vacuum system for the metalization 
of glass mirrors. There are two obstacles in the way of 
getting a high vacuum in such a system. First, outgassing 
by heating is precluded on account of the use of wax seals 
and on account of the fact that the system may contain thick 
glass mirrors which cannot be safely heated. Second, 
there is more chance of small leaks appearing than in a

static vacuum system, since the system shown in Fig. 4 
must be repeatedly opened. The recent development of fast 
oil diffusion pumps, which give the degree of vacuum required 
in spite of these obstacles, has been mainly responsible for the 
modern extensive use of this type of flexible vacuum system. 

Diffusion pumps. Diffusion pumps will operate only if 
the pressure is less than a few tenths of a millimeter of mer- 
cury, and they operate best with a "backing pressure" of a 
few hundredths of a millimeter of mercury. The necessary 
"backing pressure" is obtained by mechanical pumps. The 
operation of a mercury diffusion pump is illustrated in Fig. 5. 
The pump shown here illustrates Langmuir's practical adap- 
tation of Gaede's discovery of the principle of diffusion 
pumping. 20 The following explanation of its action applies 
as well to the action of oil diffusion pumps. 

A stream of mercury vapor is obtained by heating liquid 
mercury in boiler B to a temperature of about 110°C. 
The vapor stream which 
effuses from the attached 
chimney is indicated by 
arrows. This stream 
forms a partition be- 
tween chamber N and 
chamber M . The vapor 
finally condenses on the 
water-cooled walls of 
chamber N and returns 
under the influence of 
gravity to the boiler as a 
liquid. Gas molecules in 
chamber N which diffuse 
into the vapor partition have a small chance of penetrating 
it and entering chamber M. Rather, it is more probable 
that they will be carried by the stream back into chamber N. 
However, gas molecules in M which diffuse into the vapor

partition are carried along by molecular bombardment into 
N, where they are removed by the mechanical pump. 

The pressure in N must exceed 
that in M by a factor of the order 
of 100 if the rate of diffusion is 
to be the same in both direc- 
tions across the vapor partition. 
Where N is evacuated by an aux- 
iliary diffusion pump instead of 
the mechanical pump, pressures 
of 10 -7 mm of mercury or lower 
can be obtained in a tight glass 
apparatus connected to M (pro- 
vided mercury vapor is removed with a liquid air trap). 

Mercury pumps have been studied by many investi- 
gators. 21 Figs. 6 to 12 are 
representative of the de- 
signs which have evolved 
as a result of these studies. 
We will not discuss these 
pumps in detail, as we are 
mainly interested in this 
chapter in kinetic vacuum 
systems and oil diffu- 
sion pumps. With oil 
pumps it is not uncommon 
to have pumping speeds of 
some tens or hundreds of 
liters per second, whereas 
with mercury diffusion pumps the speeds are ordinarily only 
a fraction of a liter per second up to a few liters per second.

The use of oils as diffusion pump liquids. There have 

been many attempts to find a substitute for mercury as a 
pumping medium, for the use of mercury has one consider- 
able disadvantage, namely, its vapor pressure is so high that 
traps are required to prevent it from diffusing into the vac- 
uum system and destroying the vacuum. These traps, 
having a high resistance to the flow of gas, choke the pump. 
The only widely used substi- 
tutes for mercury are oils. The 
oils used for this purpose are 
either especially refined petro- 
leum oils of the naphthene type 
as developed by C. R. Burch, 22 
or they are organic compounds 
such as butyl phthalate as de- 
veloped by Hickman and San- 
ford 23 of the Eastman Kodak 
Laboratories. Recently, Hick- 
man has recommended a new 
synthetic organic oil called 
Octoil, which is claimed to be 
superior to butyl phthalate. 24 
Oils of the type developed by 
Burch are manufactured under 
Metropolitan Vickers' patents under the trade name of 
Apiezon oil. 26 Similar oils are now available in this country 
which yield pressures below 10~ 6 mm of mercury. 26 

Oil pumps have the advantage over mercury pumps that 
they do not require traps except in certain applications.

TECHNIQUE OF HIGH VACUUM [Chap. Ill 



Another advantage is that oil pumps may be fabricated 
either from steel or from brass and copper, whereas metal 
mercury pumps must be constructed of steel with welded 
joints. Brass and copper pumps can be assembled with soft 

solder, except for the boiler 
and chimney, where it is ad- 
visable to use silver solder. 
Aside from the questions of 
traps and construction, the 
contrast between oil and 
mercury pumps is less dis- 
tinct. Oil pumps without 
traps do not give quite as 
low a limiting pressure as 
trapped mercury pumps, al- 
though their speed may be 
many times greater. If 
traps are used, there is 
probably little difference 
between the limiting pres- 
sures attainable. Oil 
pumps have the advan- 
tage that a baked-out total 
obstruction charcoal tube 
at room temperature is as 
effective as a liquid air 
trap. However, the use of 
a total obstruction charcoal 
trap sacrifices the higher 
pumping speed of the oil pump. 

It is not advisable to use a single oil pump. One should 
use at least two oil pumps in series. The second pump serves 
to keep the oil in the first purified. The limiting pressure 
is about tenfold lower when a second pump is used. Be- 
cause mercury pumps will operate against a slightly higher 
back pressure than oil pumps, there are many cases in which 
a single mercury diffusion pump is adequate.

Oil diffusion pumps. Oil diffusion pumps are like mer- 
cury diffusion pumps in several respects. They have the 
same functional elements — a boiler to vaporize the oil and a 
chimney for conducting the vapor to the jet. The two 
types of pumps are also similar in the way in which they 
function. The oil vapor is projected from the jet across the 
throat of the pump and condenses 
on the cooled walls which form 
the outer boundary of the throat; 
and the condensed oil drains 
from the condensing surface back 
into the boiler by gravity. The 
vapor jet may be arranged in 
several ways: It may be directed 
upward as in the up-jet mercury 
pump shown in Fig. 5, it may be 
directed downward as in the um- 
brella down-jet mercury pump 
shown in Fig. 6, or it may pro- 
ject laterally as shown in Fig. 7. 

Although oil and mercury 
diffusion pumps have the same 
functional elements, they differ 
in the details of construction. 
The construction of oil diffusion 
pumps can be carried out in an 
ordinary machine shop. The important considerations for 
proper construction are outlined below: 

1. The oil is decomposed slightly at the working tempera- 
tures of the boiler. This decomposition is accelerated by the 
higher temperature necessary when the cross section of the 
boiler is not large enough to afford an adequate surface from 
which to create vapor, or when the chimney and jet are not 
ample to deliver the required amount of vapor without an 
excessively high pressure drop. 

2. Since oil has a low latent heat, the pump should be 
designed so that the heat required to maintain the working

temperature of the chimney and jet is supplied by conduc- 
tion from the heater rather than by condensation of oil 
vapor. Naturally, copper is the best ma- 
terial for constructing the chimney on 
account of its large heat conductivity. 

3. The decomposition of the oil is cata- 
lyzed by copper and brass and not by 
nickel. Accordingly, all parts of the 
pump exposed to the hot oil should be 
nickel-plated. 27 

4. The amount of oil decomposed in a 
given time is proportional to the amount 
of oil present in the boiler. It is, there- 
fore, advisable to have only a shallow 
layer of oil in 
the boiler. 

5. At least 
two single -jet 
pumps in series 
should be used. 
Multiple-jet 
pumps are not 

recommended because of the diffi- 
culty of regulating the flow of va- 
por to the various jets and of sup- 
plying the necessary amount of 
vapor required by them without 
an excessive boiler temperature. 

6. Throat clearances narrower 
than | inch are practical only for 
up-jet pumps. Condensed oil will 
bridge gaps of this narrowness in 
pumps of the down-jet type. 

7. Backward evaporation of the oil into the pumping line 
should be restrained by the use of baffles.

8. Cold oil is a better solvent for many gases and vapors 
than hot oil. Accordingly, the condensed oil should be 
returned to the boiler at the maximum temperature possible. 
Otherwise, a certain amount of the exhaust gases and vapors 
dissolve in the condensed oil 
and contaminate it. 

9. The use of electric heat 
for the boiler is advisable, 
since it is subject to more 
delicate control than gas 
heat. A Calrod heater unit, 
such as used in electric stoves, 
can be re-coiled into a helix 
of 2 inches in outside diameter 
or as a flat spiral of smaller 
dimensions. 

Figs. 13 to 18 illustrate 
several oil pumps which are 
currently popular. 28 The 
pump shown in Fig. 13, de- 
signed by Sloan, Thornton, 
and Jenkins, satisfies the re- 
quirements for good design 
outlined above and at the same 
time combines these features 
together with simplicity of 
construction. The following 
description of this pump is a quotation from a paper of 
Sloan, Thornton, and Jenkins. 29 

The Apiezon oil diffusion pump was originally developed by 
the Metropolitan Vickers Company in England for this very pur-

pose of continuously exhausting radio tubes. The oil is sold 
commercially in this country. 

Fig. 13 is typical of the simplified designs which have been 
widely adopted in this country. The outer shell 2" in diameter 
consists of a water-jacketed brass cylinder with a copper plate 
silver-soldered into its bottom. In the cavity beneath the bottom 
plate is placed an electric heater which boils the Apiezon "B" oil at 
less than 200°C in the chamber above. The oil vapor rises 

through the copper chimney 
e * haust and is deflected downward 

by a spun copper umbrella. 
The T V clearance between 
the edge of the umbrella and 
the condensing wall is not 
critical, although an opti- 
mum exists for any specified 
set of pressures. Around 
the chimney is a glass heat 
shield, and a metal baffle 
plate to retard the rise of oil 
vapor from the roof of the 
boiler, but these can be 
omitted without serious 
consequences. The two 
baffles above the umbrella 
prevent the escape of oil 
vapor directly into the re- 
gion being evacuated. The 
convenient baffle system shown here reduces the speed .of the pump 
to less than half, so that its overall speed is only thirty liters 
per second. This is more than sufficient for these oscillator 
tubes, since the connecting system reduces the speed to less than 
ten liters per second. A pressure in the oscillators of 10~ 5 mm is 
sufficient. 

Incidentally, the same general design is also well suited to larger 
pumps of 4" and 6" diameter, for use with larger tubes. The 
speed of an oil pump can be greatly increased by enlarging the 
diameter of the overhead region which contains the baffles neces- 
sary to guard against escaping oil vapor.

A 2-inch pump of such construction will have a pumping 
speed of about 30 liters/sec, or a speed factor slightly greater 
than 50 per cent. 

If such a high speed is not needed, an up-jet pump may 
serve. Fig. 14 shows Hickman and Sanford's all-glass de- 
sign of an up-jet pump. 

Fig. 15 shows an all-metal 
up-jet pump designed by Ed- 
win McMillan. 30 With the 
boiler temperature adjusted to 
give maximum pumping speed, 
this pump will work at a rate 
of 4 liters/sec. against a back- 
ing pressure of \ mm of mer- 
cury. If the boiler tempera- 
ture is too high, the action 
of the pump will be erratic, 
since returning condensed oil 
interferes with the vapor jet. 

A design combining glass 
and metal construction, devel- 
oped by Joseph E. Hender- 
son, 31 is shown in Fig. 16. He 
reports this pump to be capa- 
ble of working against a back- 
ing pressure of a few tenths of 
a millimeter pressure in con- 
trast to the pressure of about 
ijo nun required for oil pumps 
with a throat opening of \ inch 
or more. Pressures as low as 
10~ 8 mm of mercury were obtained 
operated with a charcoal trap.

A pump designed by Zabel with a novel oil heater added by 
James A. Bearden 32 is shown in Fig. 17. The advantage of 
a pump of this design is that it quickly starts working after 
the heater is turned on. 

More recently, K. C. D. Hickman and others have experi- 
mented with pumps in which the oil is continually purified. 33 

Pumps of this type are particularly 
suitable for work with gases and 
vapors which dissolve in the oil or 
decompose it. Fig. 18 shows a pump 
which incorporates some of the re- 
sults of Hickman's investigations. 

Mercury traps. Mercury vapor 
diffuses from a mercury diffusion 
pump into the exhausted vessel un- 
less it is removed in a trap by con- 
densation on a cold surface. Besides 
the inconvenience and expensive ne- 
cessity of requiring a refrigerant, the 
use of traps has the more serious 
result of choking the pump. This 
is especially true for big mercury 
pumps of high speed. For example, 
a mercury pump with a speed of sev- 
eral hundred liters per second at its 
throat may have an effective speed 
beyond the trap of only several tens 
of liters per second. 

The common trap designs for con- 
densing mercury and water vapors 
are illustrated in Fig. 19. Type A, the simplest, is fre- 
quently used for trapping the vapors from a McLeod 
gauge. It is also useful in conjunction with an ioniza- 
tion or Pirani gauge for hunting leaks. Type B, the most

tube. Both types A and B 

are immersed in the refrigerant 

liquid. Types C, C, and C" 

contain their own refrigerant, 

but because of inferior heat 

insulation these traps are less 

economical to keep cold. 

As refrigerant liquids for 
trapping mercury and water 
vapor, either liquid air or dry 
ice in acetone may be used. 
The temperature of the for- 
mer varies from — 190°C. to 
— 183°C, depending on the ex- 
tent to which the nitrogen has 
been boiled out of the liquid 
air, leaving liquid oxygen. Fig. 18.

The temperature of dry ice-acetone mixture is about — 78°C. 
At the temperature of liquid air the vapor pressure of mer- 
cury is 1.7 X 1CT 27 mm, while at -78°C. it is 3.2 X 1(T 9 mm. 
For trapping water, liquid air temperatures are sufficiently 
low. However, since the vapor pressure of ice is about 
10~" 3 mm at —78°, the dry ice-acetone mixture is not suffi- 
ciently cold to trap water vapor effectively. Accordingly, 
when this refrigerant is used for mercury, it is necessary at 




Fig. 19. 

the same time to expose anhydrous phosphorus pentoxide 
in the vacuum in order to remove the water vapor. 

The vapor pressure of the vacuum pump oils used in 
roughing pumps, according to Dushman, is 10~ 3 to 10 -4 mm 
at ordinary temperatures, ^ of this value at 0°C, and 
negligibly small at the temperature of dry ice or liquid air. 

Carbon dioxide is adequately trapped by traps cooled by 
liquid air, since its vapor pressure, at liquid air temperature, 
varies from 10 -6 mm to 10~ 7 mm. Carbon monoxide, 
methane, ethane, and ethylene, having considerably higher 
vapor pressures, are not effectively trapped even by a 
liquid air trap. 



Chap. Ill] TECHNIQUE OF HIGH VACUUM 123 

Virtual leaks. Gases will condense when their partial 
pressure is above the vapor pressure corresponding to the 
trap temperature. (However, they will re-evaporate later 
when the pumps reduce the pressure to a sufficiently low 
value.) This condensation may give rise to a virtual leak 
if the trap is cooled too soon after the evacuation of a system 
is started. We use the term virtual leak because the system 
appears to have a leak, when it is, in fact, quite tight. As 
an example, consider a system with traps cooled with a dry 
ice-acetone mixture but with phosphorus pentoxide omitted. 
Some of the water vapor originally in the system, both in the 
air and from the walls where it is held adsorbed, will be con- 
densed in the trap. As the evacuation of the system pro- 
ceeds, the pressure will approach a limit of 10 -3 mm, this 
being the pressure of the water vapor in the trap, and the 
system will exhibit all the "symptoms" of a leak. The 
same effect is encountered if liquid air is put on the system 
too soon. Some of the water vapor will condense on the 
upper regions of the trap walls, and as the liquid air level 
around the trap falls, owing to evaporation, the temperature 
of the water condensed as ice will rise until it begins to 
sublime, producing a virtual leak. On the one hand, these 
ice crystals are too cold to evaporate rapidly and be evac- 
uated by the system (or colder regions of the trap), while, 
on the other hand, they are warm enough to degrade the 
vacuum. Likewise, gases like ethylene may condense in a 
trap cooled by liquid air and degrade the vacuum. 

To avoid virtual leaks, the proper procedure is to keep the 
traps warm until a vacuum is obtained at which mercury 
begins to diffuse into the evacuated apparatus, that is, until 
a pressure of about 10 -2 mm is obtained. Then the tip of 
the trap is cooled until the vacuum reaches its limit, P , 
and finally the trap is immersed in the liquid air to the 
full depth. 

"Oil" traps. The vapor pressures of vacuum-pumping 
oils, such as Apiezon "B" oil, are very low, but gases pro- 
duced by thermal decomposition of the oil may give rise 



124 TECHNIQUE OF HIGH VACUUM [Chap. Ill 

to some deterioration of the vacuum and necessitate the use 
of traps. For example, when Bearden evacuated an X-ray 
tube with the diffusion pump shown in Fig. 17, he found that 
a carbon deposit formed on the target of the tube. 34 He 
found, also, that the filaments of the tube deteriorated at an 
excessive rate. However, the use of a refrigerated trap 
greatly reduced these effects. The trap he used was cooled 
with dry ice in alcohol. 

The trap shown in Fig. 20 was designed by Hickman for 
diffusion pumps which use Octoil. 35 According to him, it is 
sufficient to cool the trap with running water. Electric re- 
frigerator units are sometimes 
used to trap vapors from oil 
pumps. These are, naturally, 
justified only in large and 
permanent installations. 

In ordinary experimental 
work, charcoal traps are satis- 
fy 20. factory for use with oil diffu- 
sion pumps. Several charcoal 
trap designs are shown in Fig. 21. Of these, the total ob- 
struction trap, A, is the most effective, although it has the 
highest resistance, W, for the gases passing through it. 
Becker and Jaycox suggested a trap of type A. They found 
that a charcoal trap removed oil and condensable vapors to 
such a degree that an ionization gauge indicated a "pressure" 
as low as 10 -8 mm of mercury. 36 This has been confirmed 
by Joseph E. Henderson. 37 

When charcoal traps become charged with oil and vapors, 
it is necessary to bake them out. Becker and Jaycox ob- 
served that condensed pump oils are decomposed by baking 
them in contact with charcoal, and that the decomposition 
products are gases.

Construction of kinetic vacuum systems. Glass was 
formerly used extensively for the construction of vacuum 
apparatus, but now metal has replaced it for many uses. 
Glass as a construction material is characterized by its 
transparency, high electrical insulating quality, and by the 
fact that it is easily cleaned and may be baked out and sealed 
off to give a more or less permanent vacuum. Also, aux- 
iliary parts can be welded to an apparatus without the use 
of any gaskets or sealing wax. These welds are easily 
tested for leaks with a spark. 

Unfortunately, large and complicated apparatus is diffi- 
cult to construct from glass. On the other hand, large 
vacuum systems made of metal are not fragile, and repairs 
and alterations on them can be easily made in the machine 
shop. 

The metal most frequently used is yellow brass. A 
vacuum-tight apparatus can be made from plates and cylin-

cylinders, and so forth, may be fitted together with rubber or 
lead fuse-wire gaskets. The brass parts may also be soft- 
soldered or silver-soldered, depending on the temperature 
resistance and strength required. 

Steel apparatus may be soft-soldered, silver-soldered, 
brazed, or welded. Electric welding is quite satisfactory 
for vacuum work if it is done in two or three "passes" with 
shielded electrodes. It is generally less subject to leaks than 
gas welding, and it does not warp the work as much. Steel 
vacuum tanks, especially if they are rusty, are sometimes 
coated on the inside with Apiezon wax "W" to stop leaks 
as well as to offer a surface which does not give off gas. 

Since metal vacuum walls outgas more than glass, small 
leaks are more difficult to find. It is a common procedure 
to coat the outside of metal apparatus with lacquer, which 
seals small leaks and at the same time gives a workmanlike 
appearance to the apparatus. Glyptal is heat resistant. 
For example, it may even be used for coating the outside 
surfaces of diffusion-pump boilers. 

Many things are exposed in kinetic vacuum systems which 
one would not expose in static vacuum systems. Chief 
among them are rubber (especially as used for gaskets), 
waxed packing, beeswax and rosin mixture, Apiezon wax, 
and ordinary machined metal parts which are not outgassed. 

Wood, paints and varnishes, porous cements, and rust 
should not be exposed even in a kinetic vacuum system. 

Rubber hose may be used for connections, and with a 
pinch clamp it serves as a venting device. Rubber should 
not be exposed to high vacuum if pressures of the order of 
1CT 6 or less are desired. 

Joints. Two tubes of glass or metal may be butt-joined 
by slipping a wide rubber band over them. The rubber 
surface, including the junctions of the rubber to the tubes, is 
painted with several coats of shellac as shown in Fig. 22. 
This type of joint is easily disconnected. For small tubes,

a short length of rubber hose makes a convenient connection. 
Rubber tape or strips of raw rubber may also be used. Inas- 
much as rubber is somewhat permeable to some gases and 
gives off hydrogen sulphide and other vapors in vacuum, the 
connected tubes should always 
fit together neatly to decrease 
the area of rubber exposed. 
The joint may be first wrapped 
with sheet aluminum and then 
with rubber. 38 This procedure 
decreases the area of rubber 
exposed. If any considerable area of rubber is exposed, it is 
advisable to boil it in a 15 per cent caustic solution (potas- 
sium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide) to dissolve free sulphur 
and remove talc from its surface. It is then washed with 
water and dried, either with alcohol or by a vacuum pump. 
If rubber tubing becomes porous and checked with age, 
it should be painted on the outside with castor oil.

Two metal tubes may be joined with flanges which are 
sealed with a tongue and groove joint fitted with a rubber 
gasket as shown in Fig. 23. This construction is recom-

They recommend the use of a piece of thin aluminum sheeting with it. 



128 



TECHNIQUE OF HIGH VACUUM [Chap. Ill 



mended where mechanical strength is desired and also where 
the joint must withstand moderate internal pressure. The 
tongue should have the same thickness as the groove to 
within a few thousandths of an inch, so that the rubber 
gasket will not extrude as the pressure for fitting the joint 
is applied. The gasket is cut from a sheet of packing with a 
cutter like the one shown. The rubber gasket is used dry, 
and if the tongue and groove have bright smooth surfaces, 
the joint is sure to be free from leaks. Furthermore, the 
joint exposes very little rubber surface to the vacuum system. 

In another type of joint, 
shown in Fig. 24, a lead fuse 
wire can be used as a gasket in- 
stead of rubber. The gasket in 
this case is a loop of 20-ampere 
fuse wire, butt-welded by 
means of the heat from a match 
and a little soldering flux. The 
circumference of this loop is 
made slightly shorter than re- 
quired and is stretched into 
the groove to make a snug fit. 
The pressure applied in the 
flange flows the lead into inti- 
mate contact with the two elements of the joint. Lead-wire 
joints can be used on systems to operate at elevated tempera- 
tures, since they will hold to higher temperatures than tongue 
and groove joints sealed with rubber. A lead gasket of this 
type is used on the 40-inch bell jar for aluminizing astro- 
nomical mirrors as shown in Fig. 13 of Chapter IV. This 
particular joint has been made more than a hundred times, 
and it has been consistently vacuum-tight. Aluminum 
wire holds to even higher temperatures. 

Seals. It is frequently necessary to make a vacuum-tight 
seal between a glass bell jar and a metal base plate. For- 
merly, stopcock grease was used, applied to the foot of the bell 
jar. This type of seal was not always tight, and the grease

frequently entered the apparatus and contaminated exposed 
surfaces. A better procedure is to use wax instead of stop- 
cock grease. The bell jar is set on the base plate, both the 
foot of the bell jar and the base plate being clean and dry. 
Beeswax and rosin mixture, 
smoking hot, is then applied 
with a medicine dropper to 
the outer edge of the bell-jar 
flange to effect the seal, as il- 
lustrated by Fig. 25. The bell 
jar can be removed from the 
base plate in the following 
manner: After scraping away 
the wax with a putty knife, 
loosen the jar by striking a 
sharp blow at the top with the 
palm of the hand or by driv- 
ing a razor blade gently under 
the edge of the jar. If a metal bell jar is used, a recess may 
be provided so that the seal can be cracked by prying with a 
screw driver after as much of the wax as possible has been 
scraped away. 

Windows may be sealed over observation ports in a similar 
manner. The wax is applied with the medicine dropper, and 
the seal is effected without sensibly heat- 
ing either the port or the window. 

Windows may be sealed with hard wax. 
It is necessary to heat both the port and 
the window to temperatures above 100°C. 
when hard waxes such as Apiezon "W," 
Picein, shellac, or DeKhotinsky wax are 
used. First the window and port are care- 
fully cleaned, and then the window is 
clamped in the desired position. After being heated to the 
required temperature, the wax is applied to the outside edge 
of the window, from where it will be drawn between the 
window and the port by capillary force. The wax drawn

Fig. 27. 



under the window forms a thin bonding layer of large area, 
which exposes a minimum surface of wax to the vacuum. 
(See Fig. 26.) 

Fig. 27 shows the procedure for sealing two glass tubes 
together with Picein wax to form a butt joint or telescope 

joint. The procedure here is to 
wrap a soft strip of Picein around 
the warmed glass tubes. This strip 
is molded from a stick of wax after 
it is thoroughly softened. The stick 
of wax is softened by alternately heating it in a Bunsen flame 
until its surface is liquid and withdrawing it to cool until its 
surface solidifies. When the strip is ready and while it 
is still soft it is wrapped around the warmed joint and molded 
as shown in Fig. 27. The wax will not stick to the fingers if 
they are damp. After the glass and wax are cool, a flame is 
applied to fuse the wax superficially and insure tangential 
contact to the tubing. 

Electrodes. In the chapter on glass blowing, we dis- 
cussed the construction details for leading electrical con- 
ductors into glass apparatus. 
In a kinetic vacuum system, 
electrodes are usually 
fastened through holes in 
a metal wall. Construction 
details are shown in Fig. 28 
for high-current conductors 
and in Fig. 29 for high- 
potential conductors. The 
high-current conductor or 
electrode consists of a 
brass screw bolted into the 
vacuum wall, the head and 
body of the screw being insulated from the metal vacuum 
wall with mica. After the insulation has been tested with 
a lamp, the whole assembly is made vacuum-tight by coating 
the screwhead, insulation, and the local area of the outside

or with glyptal lacquer. Beeswax and rosin mixture is used 
if the operation temperature is about room temperature. 
Glyptal, after baking to polymerize it, is used for operation 
temperatures up to about 100°C. 

The electrode just described does not have high insulating 
qualities. Where better insulation is needed, a capillary 
glass tube is used in either of the ways shown in Fig. 29. 
In either case the electrode is easily removable for cleaning 
off condensed metallic vapors, for replacement of the glass,

and so forth. If the conductor wire is tungsten, it may be 
sealed directly to the Pyrex capillary. The capillary, with 
its central conductor, is first sealed in a bored machine screw 
with pure shellac or DeKhotinsky wax. This is then screwed 
through the walls of the vacuum system and made tight with 
beeswax and rosin mixture applied on the outside. 

Valves. Valves are used on the low-vacuum side of diffu- 
sion pumps to prevent oil in the mechanical pumps from 
flowing into the other parts of the apparatus. Between the 
diffusion pumps and the apparatus, large valves are useful 
to allow by-passing the diffusion pumps. For example, in 
the vacuum system shown in Fig. 4, a large 4-inch valve 
makes it possible to open up the main vacuum chamber

and re-evacuate it without destroying the vacuum in the 
diffusion pumps. Valves between various parts of a large 
vacuum system facilitate narrowing the search for leaks, 
since one part after another can be isolated. 

The simplest valve for venting a vacuum system is a short 
length of rubber hose and a pinch clamp. Rubber vacuum 
hose is now available in sizes up to 1 inch in diameter. 39 
This large hose may be used in short lengths on the high- 
vacuum side of the diffusion 
pump when the pumps have a 
high capacity and when a vac- 
uum of only 10 -4 is desired. 
Usually, however, it is advis- 
able to confine the use of rub- 
ber hose to the low-vacuum 
side of the diffusion pumps. 
Ordinary plumbing valves 
can bemodifiedforuse in high- 
vacuum work. The glands are 
repacked with twine soaked 
in Apiezon compound "Q," 
beeswax, stopcock grease, or 
universal wax. Since the rub- 
ber gaskets supplied in these 
valves are often too hard for 
vacuum work, it is necessary 
to replace them with softer rubber. It is advisable to make a 
new end for the valve so that the new gasket rubber can be 
retained in a groove. The outside of the valve may be 
painted with shellac or glyptal lacquer as insurance against 
leaks, it may be coated with Apiezon wax "W," or it may be 
tinned. DuMond and Rose have described valves equipped 
with a sylphon bellows as a substitute for a packing gland. 40 
This is illustrated in Fig. 30. A packless valve of this type

manufactured by the Hoffman Company can be readily 
adapted to vacuum work as shown in Fig. 31. 41 

Ordinary stopcocks can be sealed with stopcock grease 
for use in a high-vacuum system. Stopcock grease is made 
by digesting 1 part pale crepe 
rubber cut in small pieces with 
1 part Apiezon compound 
"M." This digestion is carried 
out in a balloon flask with pro- 
longed mechanical stirring at 
an elevated temperature ob- 
tained by means of a water or 
steam bath. 

When it is necessary to 
avoid grease on a stopcock, 
bankers' sealing wax, Apiezon 
wax "W," or Picein can be 
used. 42 Of these waxes, Picein 
exhibits the best body. With any one of them the valve 
is warmed until the wax becomes plastic each time that it 
is turned. (See Fig. 32.) Stopcocks may be lubricated 
with dry graphite and sealed with mercury. 

Mechanical motion. Mechan- 
ical motion can be introduced 
into a vacuum system through 
nonferrous vacuum walls with 
a magnet. An armature or bar 
magnet is fastened to the mov- 
ing part inside the system and 
actuated by an electromagnet 
outside. The armature can be 
hermetically sealed in a glass 
tube to avoid outgassing.

A metal bellows can be used to introduce the reciprocating 
or oscillating motion of a lever. 43 When the end of the 
lever executes a circular motion, this motion can be trans- 
formed into rotation inside the vacuum. 

Van de Graaf has developed the high-speed sealed shaft 
shown in Fig. 33. The packing used is Apiezon grease "M" 
charged with graphite, and the pumping action of the right- 

and left-handed screws, cut 
on the shaft, prevents the 
extrusion of the packing com- 
pound. 

Mechanical motion can be 
introduced through an ordi- 
nary packing gland packed 
with cotton twine soaked in 
Apiezon compound "Q" as 
shown in Fig. 4. 

Leaks. In planning a metal 
vacuum system, a part of the 
construction cost should be 
set aside to provide suitable 
fittings, plugs, plates, and tie bolts. The use of these makes 
it possible to pump air or hydrogen into separate compart- 
ments of the apparatus until the pressure is 50 or 100 
lbs. /square inch. For detecting leaks the pumped-up com- 
partment is submerged in water or painted with liquid- 
soap solution. Hydrogen, which may be used instead of 
air to pump up the apparatus, has the advantage over air 
that it diffuses through small holes approximately four 
times faster. When leaks are found, they may be repaired 
by welding or soldering or by merely peening the surface. 
After the whole apparatus is put together, the outside of the 
system is coated with several layers of glyptal varnish, al- 
ternating the color of the varnish coats, say blue and red, to 
facilitate complete coverage with each one of them. If possi- 
ble, the coating is baked at a temperature of about 120°C.

Leaks are usually found in a glass apparatus by passing 
the ungrounded high-potential electrode of a spark coil or 
high-frequency coil over the surface of the glass. When the 
electrode comes near the leaking channel, a spark jumps to 
it and causes residual gas inside the apparatus to become 
luminous. As a safety precaution, a spark gap of \ to \ inch 
should be connected in parallel with the electrode and the 
ground to prevent an excessive potential which might 
puncture the glass. 

Leaks in metal apparatus which are not detected by 
immersing the apparatus in water or painting it with soap 
solution are more difficult to locate. In general, the pro- 
cedure for finding them involves covering the walls of the 
apparatus with a liquid which solidifies, with water, or with 
a gas. In any case, while the search is in progress, the 
apparatus is maintained at the lowest pressure possible. 

If a liquid covering is used, it is applied to local areas in 
progression until the offending region is located. As cover- 
ing one may use a molten mixture of beeswax and resin, or 
it may be a thick solution of either shellac in alcohol or 
glyptal lacquer brushed on the walls, or it may be cellulose 
acetate solution sprayed on the walls. When a solution of 
shellac (or lacquer) is applied to the outside of a leaking 
channel, the solution is drawn into the channel by the 
vacuum. As the solvent evaporates from this solution into 
the vacuum chamber, the liquid in the channel congeals. 
Thus, the leaking channel is, in effect, filled with a solid 
shellac core. The amount of solvent passing into the 
vacuum through this core is negligible in cases where the 
procedure is suitable. 

When the leak is covered with the solution, the vacuum 
usually improves at once. This improvement may be indi- 
cated by the disappearance of luminosity in a connected dis- 
charge tube and finally by sparking across an alternate gap. 
If an ionization or Pirani vacuum gauge is used, covering of 
the leak is indicated by motion of the spot of light on the 
scale of the instrument. 



136 TECHNIQUE OF HIGH VACUUM [Chap. Ill 

The general region in which leaks are located may be 
determined by temporarily covering the region with water. 
As the vapor pressure of water is only about ^V of an atmos- 
phere, the leak may be expected to be attenuated 30-fold 
when it is covered. 

The third procedure for finding leaks involves covering 
general regions of the apparatus with gas, carbon dioxide 
for the top parts, since it is heavier than air, and illuminating 
gas for the bottom. Webster has described the use of a 
rubber "coffer dam" to facilitate the management of the 
gas. 44 Illuminating gas may be blown on various parts of 
the apparatus from a hose, or the surface may be gone over 
with a wad of cotton wet with ether. Evidence that the 
leak is admitting gas instead of air is a change in character 
of the luminescence in a discharge tube connected to the 
apparatus or a change in reading of a vacuum gauge sepa- 
rated from the apparatus by a liquid air trap. 

There are two procedures for using a discharge tube 
with illuminating gas, carbon dioxide, or ether. By the first, 
the obtainable vacuum is necessarily so poor, on account of 
the leak, that a distinct discharge is obtained. When the 
leak is covered, the luminosity in the positive column changes 
from the brownish-red color characteristic of air to the 
bluish-green of carbon dioxide or to the white of gas and 
ether. By the second procedure, used when the leak is 
small and a lower pressure is attainable in the system, the 
luminosity in the discharge is feeble. Webster suggests 
connecting the discharge tube behind one of the diffusion 
pumps as shown in Fig. 4. The backing pumps are then 
shut off, preferably just behind the discharge tube con- 
nection. The diffusion pump compresses the gas which the 
leak may be admitting, resulting in a more brilliant lumi- 
nescence in the discharge tube. 

A liquid air trap may be connected between the apparatus 
and a vacuum when carbon dioxide or other condensable 
gases are used. With this arrangement, when the leak is 
44 Webster, D. L., Rev. Sci. Instruments, 5, 42 (1934). 



Chap. Ill] TECHNIQUE OF HIGH VACUUM 137 

admitting carbon dioxide, the trap condenses this gas, thus 
preventing it from entering the gauge. At the same time 
air and other gases which do not condense in the trap are 
removed by the pumps. As a result, even though the 
pressure in the system may have increased, an improvement 
of the vacuum is indicated. 

Obviously, a gauge which reads continuously (Knudsen, 
Pirani, or ionization gauge) is preferred to a McLeod 
gauge for hunting leaks. Relative rather than absolute 
readings of the pressure are sufficient for locating leaks. 
Thus, the Pirani and ionization gauges are satisfactory, 
although they do not give absolute pressure determinations. 

Vacuum gauges. A vacuum gauge determines the 
pressure in an evacuated apparatus by a measurement of 
some physical property of the residual gases, such as vis- 
cosity, heat conductivity, and so forth. The measurement 
of the response of a gauge to the residual gas naturally be- 
comes more delicate as the gas becomes more and more 
tenuous. Finally, below a certain pressure limit (which is 
characteristic of a given gauge) the gauge does not behave 
measurably different from what it would if the vacuum were 
perfect. For example, a discharge tube will give qualitative 
indications of pressure down to about 10 -3 mm of mercury. 
Below this pressure the tube becomes nonluminous and non- 
conducting. The characteristic limits for some of the other 
gauges are as follows: 

Ionization gauge 10 -9 mm of mercury 

Knudsen gauge 10 -6 mm of mercury 

McLeod gauge 10 -6 mm of mercury 

Pirani gauge 10 -5 mm of mercury 

Langmuir's viscosity gauge 10~ 6 mm of mercury 

The operation of the McLeod gauge depends on a definite 
volume of residual gases being compressed, so that as the 
volume decreases, the pressure is increased to a value at 
which the hydrostatic head of mercury can be measured 
with an ordinary scale. 

The ionization gauge measures with a galvanometer the 
positive ions that are formed in an electric field when the 



138 TECHNIQUE OF HIGH VACUUM [Chap. Ill 

residual gas is bombarded with electrons. The Langmuir 
gauge depends on the measurement of viscosity, and the 
Pirani gauge on the measurement of heat conduction of the 
residual gas. The Knudsen absolute manometer measures 
the momentum transferred from a hot to a cold surface by 
the gas molecules. 

Of the above gauges, only the McLeod and Knudsen are 
absolute manometers in the sense that their geometry and 
other measurable characteristics of construction and opera- 
tion determine their response at a given pressure. The 
McLeod gauge is the simplest and most reliable for perma- 
nent gases, but it has the disadvantage of giving erratic 
response or no response at all to water vapor, carbon dioxide, 
ammonia, and pump oil vapors which adsorb on the walls of 
the gauge or condense to a liquid. This disadvantage is 
serious, inasmuch as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and 
so forth are often of importance in the last stages of ob- 
taining a high vacuum. The Knudsen gauge responds to 
gases and vapors alike. 

The response of an ionization gauge is difficult to predict 
from its construction details, and it must be calibrated with a 
McLeod gauge using permanent gases. Furthermore, be- 
fore the pressure can be inferred, it is necessary to make 
corrections for the molecular weight of the gas and also for 
the possibility that the gas may be dissociated by the elec- 
tron bombardment. Quantitative application of the gauge 
is unreliable to the degree to which these corrections are 
uncertain. Likewise, the response of the Pirani gauge de- 
pends on the molecular weight of the residual gas, and it 
must be calibrated with a McLeod gauge that uses perma- 
nent gases. The same is true for the viscosity gauge. 

The McLeod gauge. 45 Although many improvements 
have been made in the McLeod gauge, they have seldom been 
applied. The gauge as ordinarily used today is essentially

140 TECHNIQUE OF HIGH VACUUM [Chap. Ill 

the same as it was originally. We will discuss here the 
simple form of the gauge illustrated in Fig. 34. It is made 
of glass as shown and is mounted on a vertical board. The 
difference in the heights of the mercury levels in the gauge 
and in the reservoir is approximately equal to the barometric 
pressure B. As the reservoir is raised, the mercury level in 
the gauge comes above the Y-branch, thus isolating a definite 
volume Vi of the residual gas. This is isolated at the un- 
known pressure Pi, the pressure of the residual gas in the 
apparatus to which the gauge is connected. As the mercury 
reservoir is further raised, the isolated residual gas is com- 
pressed, and when its volume has been reduced to a volume 
V2, the pressure is great enough to produce a sensible 
difference in the height of the mercury meniscus in the two 
capillaries, A and B. At the left, in Fig. 34, the mercury 
levels are shown at the beginning of a measurement, and at 
the right they are shown in two different positions corre- 
sponding to two methods of making readings. In one, if 
the meniscus in B is adjusted to the same height as the top 
of capillary A, the final volume, V2, is equal to Ah -a-, when 
a is the cross-section area of the capillary. The decrease 
in volume from Vi to V2 is ordinarily of the order of one- 
hundred-thousandfold, with a corresponding increase of 
pressure in the capillary over that which obtained originally. 
The construction of the gauge with the comparison capillary 
B of identical bore with A eliminates the necessity of mak- 
ing corrections for surface tension. Referring to Eq. 1, we 
see that the product P1V1 is, in this case, a constant. The 
original product, P1V1, is equal to the final product, P2V2. 
From this we get the expression connecting the unknown 
pressure with the observed manometer difference, Ah: 

* - ^- (14) 

Vi and u are constants of the gauge determined when it is 
constructed. <r is obtained by measuring the length of a 
known volume or weight of mercury in the capillary. Vi is 



Chap. Ill] TECHNIQUE OF HIGH VACUUM 141 

determined by filling the gauge with mercury. These 
original data may be recorded on the board to which the 
gauge is attached. Here they will not be lost. Values of 
Pi determined by Eq. 14 are usually laid off on a nonlinear 
scale, which is mounted behind capillary A in order that 
pressures may be read directly. 

The second procedure of making the observations on V2 
and P 2 is illustrated at the right in Fig. 34. The gas is com- 
pressed to a definite mark on capillary A at a distance Ah 
from the top, so that the final volume, V2, is the same for 
every measurement. The final pressure necessary to com- 
press volume Vi to V2 is Ah, and the pressure Pi in the sys- 
tem is determined by these quantities, according to the 
following equation: 

Pt = ^Ah. (15) 

n 

A linear pressure scale computed from this formula is 
ordinarily mounted behind capillary B. 

The McLeod gauge is thoroughly reliable for the perma- 
nent gases from 10 -1 mm to 10 -4 mm of mercury. It is 
less reliable to 10~ B mm. Below this the indications are 
only qualitative, and at 10 -6 the mercury often sticks in the 
top of capillary A. 

The gauge is most reliable after it has been outgassed by 
gently warming it with a soft flame. Three gauges with 
different values of Vi are necessary to cover adequately the 
complete pressure range from 10 _1 to 10 -6 mm. Many of 
the designs of McLeod gauges are more elaborate than the 
one shown in Fig. 34. For example, three bulbs may be 
mounted together with one reservoir, one for low pres- 
sures, one for intermediate pressures, and one for high 
pressures. 

The McLeod gauge is fragile. If it breaks, not only is 
the gauge lost but what is often more serious, mercury may 
get into the vacuum system. In glass vacuum systems using 
mercury pumps this is not as serious as it may be in kinetic 
vacuum systems. These systems, fabricated of brass with 



142 TECHNIQUE OF HIGH VACUUM [Chap. Ill 

soft-soldered joints, are attacked by mercury and the joints 
are destroyed. 

Accidents with this gauge are usually caused by bringing 
the reservoir up too quickly. Then mercury in Vi acquires 
enough momentum to shatter the bulb when the metal 
surface arrives at the opening of the capillary tube with no 
cushion of air to soften the shock. 

Admitting air into the vacuum system is to be avoided 
when the mercury is not completely out of Vi. The ad- 
mission of air will have the same result as carelessness in 
raising the reservoir. 

Sometimes a mercury pellet will remain in capillary A 
when the reservoir is lowered. It can usually be brought 
down by tapping the capillary (after the mercury is all 
out of Vi). If this treatment fails, the capillary should be 
heated with a soft gas flame. In the latter case, a sheet of 
asbestos is placed behind the capillary to protect the cali- 
bration scale from the flame. 

The capillary tubes used for the construction of McLeod 
gauges are seldom larger than 2 or 3 mm or smaller than 
^ mm bore. The volume of the bulb, Vi, ordinarily varies 
from 50 to 500 cc. Only pure distilled mercury should be 
used. Mercury is attacked by the sulphur present in rubber 
hose, so that dross is produced which adheres to the inside 
of the gauge and may become very annoying. A gauge 
contaminated with this sulphide may be cleaned out by 
the combined action of zinc dust and nitric acid. Rubber 
hose for use on a gauge should be cleaned before it is used 
by passing hot caustic potash solution back and forth 
through it for a quarter of an hour or so. The tubing 
should be thoroughly washed free of caustic and dried 
before use. 

In cases where it is necessary to avoid contamination of 
the vacuum system with mercury vapor, a liquid air trap 
should be connected between the vacuum system and the 
gauge. For kinetic vacuum systems this precaution is 
often omitted. A stopcock between the gauge and the

system which is kept closed when the gauge is not in use 
minimizes contamination. 

The ionization gauge. 46 Ionization gauges are triodes 
mounted in a glass bulb connected to the apparatus in which 
the pressure is to be measured. They are electrically con- 
nected as shown in Fig. 35. 

Electrons emitted from the filament are accelerated to 
the grid, and their momentum would carry them to the 
plate if an inverse field more than sufficient to prevent this 
were not impressed between the 
grid and the plate. They there- 
fore return to the grid and are 
finally collected on it. However, 
while they are between the grid 
and the plate, they bombard and 
ionize some of the molecules of 
the residual gas present there. 
These ions are collected on the 
plate and measured with a sensi- 
tive galvanometer. The ratio 
of this ion current to the current of bombarding electrons or 
grid current is proportional to the pressure at pressures below 
about 10 -4 mm. 

An ionization gauge may be made from an ordinary 
three-element radio tube equipped with a glass connection 
to the vacuum system. Such gauges are useful for the 
pressure range from 10 -3 to 10 -6 mm of mercury. 

Fig. 36 shows the construction details of a gauge designed 
to have higher insulation of the plate than an ordinary radio 
tube. Measurements with it are possible to a pressure 
of 10~ 9 mm of mercury. The upper end of a glass bulb 
supports the plate assembly, while the lower end supports 
the combined grid and filament assembly. The grid is

made from a piece of nickel screen rolled to form a cylinder. 
This is bound mechanically to the central glass tube through 
the bottom by wrapping it with wire, and it is connected 
electrically to the grid electrode with one loose end of the 
wrapping wire. There are two filaments, but only one is 
used. The other is held in reserve to be used if the first is 

accidentally burned out. The 
filaments may be replaced by 
cutting the central tube at S. 
Expensive auxiliary electri- 
cal instruments are required 
for this gauge. They should 
be protected with Littlefuses 
as shown in the wiring diagram 
(Fig. 35). 

The plate may be outgassed 
with high-frequency currents 
or by electron bombardment. 
In the latter case, an alter- 
nating potential of 500 volts is 
applied between the filaments 
and the plate. The amount of 
heat developed depends on the 
emission from the filament, 
and this is controlled by the 
filament current. Outgassing 
of the plate and glass 
walls of the gauge is necessary if quantitative measurements 
are to be made. However, for hunting leaks it is necessary 
only to outgas the plate once. 

Dunnington has made a gauge using 30-mil helices of 
tungsten wire for both plate and grid. These helices are 
outgassed simply by passing a current through them for a 
few seconds. He found that such a gauge did not have a 
linear relationship between pressure and ratio of plate to 
grid currents. Once calibrated, however, it was found to be 
very reliable.

At a given pressure, the ratio of plate to grid current is 
different for different values of the grid current. For this 
reason, it is necessary to adjust the grid current to some 
definite value, usually in the range of 10 to 50 milliamperes. 

The Pirani gauge. 47 The Pirani gauge consists of a heated 
filament of platinum, tungsten, or some other metal with a 
high temperature coefficient of electrical resistance. The 
filament is exposed to the residual gases and is cooled by 
them. The temperature of the filament is determined by 
the heat conductivity of the residual gas, which, in turn, 
depends on the pressure. The filament may be operated 
in several ways. The most

satisfactory method is to con- 
nect the filament to one arm 
of a Wheatstone bridge and 
heat it by a constant current 
as shown in Fig. 37. If the 
bridge is balanced at one tem- 
perature of the filament, a 
change of its temperature 
caused by a change in the 

heat conductivity of the residual gases will unbalance it. 
Thus, the deflection of the bridge galvanometer indicates the 
pressure of the residual gases. 

Ordinarily, the filament is mounted in a bulb fitted with a 
connecting tube and is balanced with an identical compen- 
sating filament mounted in an adjacent arm of the bridge. 
This auxiliary bulb is evacuated and sealed off at a very low 
pressure. The use of an auxiliary bulb serves to make the 
gauge insensitive to variations in room temperature. 
Changes in the over-all temperature of one bulb are the same 
as changes in the other, so that the galvanometer does not

respond to these changes but only to the changes produced 
by the residual gas in the one bulb. 

Fig. 38 shows a calibration 
curve of a Pirani gauge manu- 
factured by E. Leybold Nach- 
folger. The pressure range 
over which it is useful extends 
from xV mm to 10 -4 mm. 

The construction of the Pi- 
rani gauge, together with the 
theory of its use, is treated in 
detail by several authors, who 
should be consulted by anyone 
planning to use the gauge for quantitative measurement. A 
gauge useful for qualitative work, as for hunting leaks, can 
be improvised from two 
ordinary 20- to 40-watt vac- 
uum tungsten lamps, one of 
which is fitted with a con- 
necting tube. Fig. 39 shows 
the construction details for 
this gauge. The bridge gal- 
vanometer should have a 
sensitivity of about 10~ 8 
ampere division. Sometimes 
uncertain contact to the sup- 
porting wires may cause 
variable heat loss from the 
filament, and this should be 
suspected if the gauge is 
erratic. Tapping will often 
define the contact. Pirani i amp k.

made with a flattened quartz fiber about 50/x thick and from 
five to ten times as wide. This quartz ribbon is about 
5 cm long and is mounted in one end of a glass tube about 
25 mm in diameter, as shown in Fig. 40. When this ribbon 
is set vibrating in a high vac- 
uum, the amplitude changes 
very slowly because the damp- 
ing by the residual gas is almost 
negligible, and, owing to the 
low internal viscosity of fused 
quartz, the loss of vibrational 
energy from this source is 
also low. From atmospheric 
pressure down to a few milli- 
meters of mercury, the damp- 
ing produced by the molecules 
of the residual gas is nearly in- 
dependent of pressure. Over 
the transition range of pres- 
sure, where the damping varies 
from this constant value to 
zero, the time required for the 
amplitude of vibration to de- 
crease to half value is an index 
of the pressure. Within this range the relation between the 
time, t, the pressure, P, and the molecular weight of the 
residual gas is given by the following formula:

Here a and b are constants of the gauge. The value of the 
ratio b/a may be obtained by observing the damping time, 
to, for an essentially perfect vacuum, that is, a pressure of 
10 -6 mm or less. For this pressure the left side of Eq. 16 
can be set equal to zero. The values of a and b are deter- 
mined from a second measurement of the time h at a definite 
pressure Pi. This pressure is determined with a McLeod

gauge. M is approximately 29 for air. The gauge may also 
be calibrated by subjecting it to saturated mercury vapor 
at a definite temperature at which the vapor pressure 
of mercury is known. The range over which the gauge is 
most useful lies between the pressures 2 X 10 -2 and 5 X 10~ 5 . 
A feature of this gauge is its small volume. Because there 
are no metal parts exposed, the gauge is suitable for measur- 
ing the pressure of corrosive gases like the halogens. This 
gauge, in conjunction with a McLeod gauge, may be used 

for measuring the molecular 
weight of an unknown gas at 
low pressures. 

The flat quartz fibers may 
be obtained by drawing them 
out of the side rather than 
the end of a quartz tube or by 
following the technique given 
in Chapter V. 

Figs. 40 and 41 show con- 
struction details and the 
method of mounting the fiber 
together with a pivoted glass 
tube, which contains an iron 
armature operated by an external electromagnet, to start the 
fiber vibrating. An optical arrangement for observing the 
amplitude of vibration is also shown. An image of the 
quartz fiber is projected on a scale with a simple lens. 

The Knudsen gauge. 49 Fig. 42 shows the Knudsen 
gauge as designed by DuMond. When this gauge is con- 
structed according to the specifications outlined by him, it 
is claimed to have a definite sensitivity, so that no prelimi- 
nary McLeod calibration for it is needed. The gauge shown 
here differs slightly from DuMond's design in that it is 
equipped with a permanent (Alnico) magnet for damping.

Also, it has a special liquid air trap for determining what 
fraction of the pressure indication is produced by con- 
densable vapors. 

The Knudsen gauge is to be preferred to the McLeod 
gauge where it is important to avoid contaminating a vacuum 
system with mercury. No expensive auxiliary instruments 
are required with the Knudsen gauge, as with the ionization 
gauge. Furthermore, the filaments will not burn out and 
the suspension is not delicate. 

It is advisable to modify DuMond's design so that all 
connections and supports fasten to one end plate. This 
facilitates making repairs. The metal case thus becomes, 
in effect, a water-cooled covering "bell jar" fitted with a 
window.
